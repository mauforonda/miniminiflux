Now you can generate images and write your first draft right inside Google Search. </p><h2>What&#39;s going on here?</h2><p>Google is adding image and drafting capabilities to its Search AI.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/45I5ZyhnduIL_CGJdPTL8Gg5ijBPpdAX7G1OvCEezbk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvNzhhMmMwYTEtNmZlNS00Zjg3LTkzNmQtMjNlNTgyYTY1ZDNkL2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>You can create images when you search for terms similar to image generation prompts, like “photorealisitic image of a cute bear”. You can refine the generated images by editing the text prompt in a chat mode after the first generation. The image tab in search results will also occasionally have a “create something new” card when you’re looking for image inspiration.</p><p>Google will also launch an “<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/about-this-image-google-search/?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=google-add-image-generation-and-long-drafts-to-search-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">About this image</a>” tool soon that will help in identifying AI-created images (based on assigned labels).</p><p>Additionally, for longer research sessions, the AI can provide written drafts to capture ideas and save time. For instance, it can generate a note to a contractor based on a garage renovation project research trail. You can export these drafts to Google Docs and Gmail.</p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>These features are only available for US users in English. Though terrible name (SGE), I’ve found it is actually helpful for Googling stuff: when I need to find stuff that I think will be deep inside some web result. Not so much, when I want to imagine something new.</p><p>Based on that previous experience, the first drafts could be a good addition. For the images, I think comparing web images and your generation side by side could be an interesting aspect.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=0b18b585-1bc9-4fec-aadc-ae3ceccea3d9&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
