The Firefly Design model generates customizable templates from text in Adobe Express.</p><p>Firefly Image 2, their new model is able to generate more diverse pictures with higher photorealism.

The new models and features allow generation of high-quality, customizable images, vectors, and templates more easily. The additional creator control over things like image quality and style matching enables realizing your vision better. </p><p>These can save time starting projects or creating assets. And that’s what Adobe is aiming for—to get the adoption by creators who are bread and butter of its media tools.</p><p>Again, the legal and copyright assurance that Adobe provides is a sigh of relief for creators/designers who want to use AI in their day jobs. Adobe’s promise of compensating stock contributors also gets them the ethics points.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=58d3cab6-b292-4ba2-9542-f98729a6c4be&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
