There were 50 possible plates to see (plus D.C.) each with distinct colors and often the state motto. Today the game of license plate bingo has gotten incredibly complex. </p><p>By my count, there are currently 8,331* different vehicle license plates offered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. States now offer a vast menu of personalized plate options for a dizzying array of organizations, professions, sports teams, causes and other groups. </p><p>My count was conducted over June and July 2023, so this should be considered a snapshot, as I&#39;m sure some plates have changed already. </p><p>For years, members of the military and veterans have been able to pick plates reflecting the honors they have received and the missions they have served in. Drivers have also been able to pick plates drawing attention to a large number of medical conditions such as breast cancer, downs syndrome, diabetes and autism, raising funds for various foundations through registration fees. </p><p>Doctors, first responders and even amateur radio operators have long been able to pick a plate reflecting their affiliations. But today, if you are a realtor, accountant, architect, chiropractor, pharmacist or optician you too can share your profession with a customized plate in several states. </p><p>Of course not just anyone can grab many of these specialized plates. Proof of service and professional credentials are required to qualify for many of these plates. Some are reserved for members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate. </p><p>You can even find the face of Dolly Parton on Tennessee&#39;s &#34;Dollywood Foundation For Children&#34; plate, and don&#39;t miss aging rocker Alice Cooper who you can find on Arizona&#39;s &#34;Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock&#34; plate (raising funds for his non-profit that provides free music lessons for kids). </p><figure><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/HV77_xMBbO-hFAzOlJeLI3J3mOorIBTOx93URPefcaA=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhdXRpZnVscHVibGljZGF0YS5jb20vY29udGVudC9pbWFnZXMvMjAyMy8wOC9saWNlbnNlLXBsYXRlLUFsaWNlLUNvb3Blci1Tb2xpZC1Sb2NrXzAuanBn" width="300" height="142" alt="All of the 8,331 License Plates in America" loading="lazy"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Rh8HkeEccdzXUfgQkuMPZAcG8KKJgMdqiESn8-zjJTc=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhdXRpZnVscHVibGljZGF0YS5jb20vY29udGVudC9pbWFnZXMvMjAyMy8wOC9Eb2xseXdvb2QtRm91bmRhdGlvbi0xLmpwZw==" width="315" height="160" alt="All of the 8,331 License Plates in America" loading="lazy"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/YNFrjEVMr-4pauJB8ILBS-5iRYX7BCUDVfaTHt1Oixw=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVhdXRpZnVscHVibGljZGF0YS5jb20vY29udGVudC9pbWFnZXMvMjAyMy8wOC9wYXRjaGVzLXBhbC1wbGF0ZS5wbmc=" width="400" height="191" alt="All of the 8,331 License Plates in America" loading="lazy"/><figcaption><p>Left to Right: Arizona&#39;s &#34;Alice Cooper&#39;s Sold Rock Teen Centers&#34; plate; Dolly Parton&#39;s Tennessee &#34;Dollywood Foundation for Children&#34; plate; Washington&#39;s &#34;J.P.

The plaintiffs objected to the fact that there was no alternative design without the slogan without having to pay an extra fee for a special plate. The court found that the plaintiff&#39;s free speech argument was valid, but recently the Governor introduced a new standard plate that does not mention God, rendering the case moot. </p><p>&#34;I consider it a victory because the Governor&#39;s previous comments suggest he would not have chosen a design without a religious reference if it were not for the pressure that was applied to him,&#34; wrote Jason Alan Griggs, one of the plaintiffs in the case in an email to Beautiful Public Data. </p><a href="mailto:?subject=Newsletter%20recommendation%3A%20Beautiful%20Public%20Data&amp;body=Hi%2C%20just%20wanted%20to%20recommend%20this%20newsletter%20I%20think%20you%20might%20like%20called%20Beautiful%20Public%20Data%3A%20A%20curated%20selection%20of%20visually%20interesting%20datasets%20collected%20by%20local%2C%20state%20and%20federal%20government%20agencies.%20By%20Jon%20Keegan.%0D%0A%0D%0ALink%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beautifulpublicdata.com/?utm_source=freferral%26utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">📣 Recommend Beautiful Public Data to a friend</a><p>A 2016 <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/transportation-license-plate-policy-update?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">report</a> from the National Conference on State Legislatures (NCSL) warned state administrators of the controversy that can come with political messages on special plates. “Specialty license plate designs may encounter resistance, however.

The searchable table, chart and dataset have been updated with these plates, and the overall count of plates was updated to 8,331.</em></p>👨🏻‍💻<strong>Nerdbox</strong><br/><br/>For this post, I had to scrape data from 51 different state motor vehicle agencies. Every site was different, which created a challenge. Some sites like <a href="https://www.in.gov/bmv/registration-plates/license-plates-overview/license-plate-designs/?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Indiana</a>&#39;s and <a href="https://www.dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/license-plates/get-custom-plates/special-design-plates?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Washington</a>&#39;s were very nicely built, with easy to read lists of plates, large plate images and clean descriptive text. Other states (I&#39;m looking at you <a href="https://www.dmv.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt416/files/inline-documents/list-of-plates-table.pdf?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/passenger-plates-manual-0/download?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Massachusetts</a>) did the minimum and just linked to a PDF with low-res blurry thumbnails of the plates.<br/><br/>I filed six freedom of information requests seeking plate issuance and revenue numbers, while some states helpfully published these numbers on their websites. You can find the responses in my <a href="https://github.com/jonkeegan/us-license-plates?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">GitHub repository</a> for this story, along with the dataset and thumbnail images.<br/><br/>Using some <a href="http://bit.ly/command-line-gfx?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">command line graphics</a> (ImageMagick) I resized the plate images to a uniform 2:1 ratio and made the sizes consistent.<br/><br/>I used Jupyter Notebooks and matplotlib to analyze the data and make the chart.🙏🏻<strong>Did you enjoy this post?</strong><br/>You can subscribe to our newsletter to get future posts delivered to your inbox for free. 👉🏻 📫 <a href="https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/subscribe#/portal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Subscribe now</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Sharing is caring</strong><br/>📣 If you think your followers or friends may like it, please consider sharing it.<br/><br/>🙋🏻‍♀️ If you have any suggestions, comments or requests, please email them to <a href="mailto:beautifulpublicdata@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">beautifulpublicdata@gmail.com</a><br/><br/>Thanks for reading!<br/>- Jon Keegan (Threads: <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jonkeeganstories?ref=beautifulpublicdata.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">@jonkeeganstories</a>)<br/>
