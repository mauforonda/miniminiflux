<p>2023-10-03</p><p>The ChatGPT plugins page mentions a number of things but my read is you can use it to call other APIs. This might work; I&#39;ll ask ChatGPT normally but then get it to call my API endpoint to log the question-and-answer. It&#39;s a feature gated by a waitlist, let&#39;s see how long this takes. In the meantime, there&#39;s fastapi.</p><p>Initial prompt: Write a simple TODO app using FastAPI, that lets users add TODOs, list their TODOs and delete TODOs.</p>
Include a `__main__` section which will run this app using uvicorn. The Python module where I save this code will be called `main.py`.
 <p>In addition to the normal endpoints, include a route `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` which serves (as JSON) the contents of `./manifest.json`, located in the same directory as `main.py`. Exclude this route from the OpenAPI spec, and don’t serve any other static content.</p><p>Follow-up prompt: Why do I need uvicorn? Can&#39;t I just use fastapi?</p><p>ChatGPT: Uvicorn and FastAPI serve different purposes:</p><p>1. **FastAPI**: It is a modern, asynchronous web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It provides the tools to define the API endpoints, request and response models, handle errors, and so on.</p><p>2. **Uvicorn**: It is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server. It&#39;s like the &#34;server&#34; part in traditional WSGI servers, except that it&#39;s designed to serve asynchronous Python applications like those you&#39;d build with FastAPI. Uvicorn serves as the interface between the web requests and your FastAPI application, handling the underlying communications, protocol translations, etc.</p><p>You can think of FastAPI as the application or logic layer and Uvicorn as the serving or hosting layer.</p><p>While you write your web app using FastAPI, you need a server like Uvicorn to run it. Uvicorn is often the recommended ASGI server for FastAPI due to its performance characteristics and because it&#39;s built to handle asynchronous applications efficiently.</p><p><br/></p><p>In theory, since FastAPI is ASGI-compliant, you could use other ASGI servers (like Daphne or Hypercorn) to serve a FastAPI application, but Uvicorn is the most common choice in the FastAPI community.</p><p><br/></p><p>To make an analogy:</p><p>- FastAPI is like the software/application you want to run.</p><p>- Uvicorn is like the operating system that runs the software/application.</p><p><br/></p><p>While it&#39;s possible to write a FastAPI application without Uvicorn by using another ASGI server, Uvicorn is the most straightforward and performant option for most use cases.</p>
