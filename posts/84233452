We will have no newsletter next week, but we have plenty of reading from this week to hold you over.</p><h2>Semantic Searches &amp; Health Info Results</h2><p>What makes finding accurate information about how to terminate a pregnancy harder? Francesca Tripodi and Aashka Dave assert that it is a combination of the searcher’s own position on abortion, as well as SEO and advertising making the top results insufficient for the searcher’s needs in “<em><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051231195548" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Abortion Near Me? The Implications of Semantic Media on Accessing Health Information</a></strong></em><strong>”</strong>.</p><p>The “information-seeking biases of the user are just as important to consider as algorithmic bias.” In the study, the intention of the participants influenced their keyword choice (ex. “abortion near me” vs. “adoption in NC”), which then influenced the information that was returned to them in the search. It does not stop at intent of the search engine user, however.</p><p>Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) rely on advertising, SEO, and websites that make their centers “look like health clinics”. 2 searches, “abortion near me” versus “alternatives for abortion”, both populating CPCs in the search result suggests Google’s advertising structure connects and classifies CPCs to the phrase “abortion” regardless of the perceived intent. This suggests that the placement of advertised CPCs is not accidental, because as research demonstrates, Google carefully calculates the placement and pricing of advertising in order to maximize profits. Corporate revenue, thus, plays a role in shaping the semantic web.</p><p>Labels provided by Google that indicate whether a location does or does not provide abortions “risk confusing the services offered by CPCs with health care centers that provide a wide range of reproductive and sexual health services, including access to exams, contraception, and testing for pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections”. The authors argue that it is important for future work to consider the complexities that arise from both users’ information-seeking biases and corporate interests, and how this impacts their ability to obtain accurate information.</p><h2>Publications and appearances</h2><p>Affiliate Andrea Lorenz, Carolyn Schmitt, Shannon McGregor, and Daniel Malmer have a new publication, “<strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.51685/jqd.2023.015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">CNN can kiss my As$</a></strong>”, in which they found that “nearly ten percent [of a nationally represented sample of 10,000] self-report at least one far-right news outlet as a primary news source… we then examined the characteristics of this small but significant group, given the current political climate in the United States, finding that far-right news consumers are overwhelmingly white, male, Republican, Christian, and without a college degree. This study reinforces previous findings that patterns in hyperpartisan media usage demonstrate growing extremism in the U.S., and that it is deeply rooted in identity.”</p><p>“We can talk all day long about sisterhood and friendship and going through with a life with a cohort of women. But fundamentally, the power of full access still resided with the men and whether they just found you desirable, and beautiful. And here race and class would always always matter, not just an Alabama would trust me, it matters. But here all of the United States and all pop culture is implicated being admitted is not the same as being a full member of what makes that sorority what it is.” <strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/slate-technology/the-waves-the-bama-rush-to-trad-wife-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Listen to</a></strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/slate-technology/the-waves-the-bama-rush-to-trad-wife-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> </a><strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/slate-technology/the-waves-the-bama-rush-to-trad-wife-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Tressie McMillan Cottom on The Waves: Gender, Relationships, Feminism podcast</a></strong> this week as she discussed her <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/22/opinion/bama-rush-tiktok-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Bama Rush NYT article</a></strong> and the Trad wife movement.</p><p>Yiping Xia, former CITAP postdoc and now ACES Assistant Professor at TAMU, looked at the question of how <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/14648849231200322" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">past news engagements shape how a person interprets a news story</a></strong>. “Temporal meaning-making” is a process where the individual thinks back to past news engagements (and sometimes, anticipated future news events) to help shape the way they understand new information. Yiping argues that news interpretation is dependent not only on the news content or the personal traits of the individual, but also on the temporal relationship they have formed with a particular news topic, such as what they have known about it from past news engagements, or what they expect to happen next. </p><h2>Coming Soon</h2><p><strong>October 16 at CITAP</strong>: Misinformation and Marginalization Symposium.
