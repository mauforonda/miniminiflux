As such, many prefer the sister concept of Transformative AI – an <em>operational </em>definition that ignores the intrinsic properties of an AI system in favor of its external impact on the economy. An AI system that can automate most human cognitive labor would thus count as TAI even if it was based on something as “dumb” as a giant look-up table. This is somewhat dissatisfying, however, as what makes recent AI progress so exciting is precisely the “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">spark of general intelligence</a>” seen in models like GPT-4.</p><p>Fortunately, the definitions of TAI and AGI converge with AI systems trained to directly emulate human cognition, as an efficient human emulator would be both transformative economically and obviously “human-level” in its generality, even if its exact mechanisms remained opaque. Large Language Models are a step in this direction, as there are good theoretical reasons to think a sufficiently large model for next word prediction trained on human-generated text will learn semantic representations <a href="https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1706342863515119717" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">that converge</a> on the representations used by humans.<a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75e267f6-ddeb-49c1-82bb-d3f939cb8b60_1344x896.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/wX7V3BHUmgIvYVnIx9D5Lklfre7v-Wk9wQxZnU4Po1A=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3NWUyNjdmNi1kZGViLTQ5YzEtODJiYi1kM2Y5MzljYjhiNjBfMTM0NHg4OTYucG5n 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/0-xHics93JqoP1eCz6k5r-Zv_stszCs0Z8sJjnx8nac=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3NWUyNjdmNi1kZGViLTQ5YzEtODJiYi1kM2Y5MzljYjhiNjBfMTM0NHg4OTYucG5n 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/0uGGevkWCjwNIHr5PB4wTLqcoL56qwcdI5AkEoLs5Vk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNzVlMjY3ZjYtZGRlYi00OWMxLTgyYmItZDNmOTM5Y2I4YjYwXzEzNDR4ODk2LnBuZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/bUcPGfxBsDy5UWrF0pxVrIJgOZSHWq03Q3W08iSNzQ8=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNzVlMjY3ZjYtZGRlYi00OWMxLTgyYmItZDNmOTM5Y2I4YjYwXzEzNDR4ODk2LnBuZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/iGmUW3B05sOGCg6F4ctFa6_1TjrMrsDrmIO39vLmTyk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNzVlMjY3ZjYtZGRlYi00OWMxLTgyYmItZDNmOTM5Y2I4YjYwXzEzNDR4ODk2LnBuZw==" alt="" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/LxEg6Pb83KDPV-c-scgJgDepJ18jMz_yDrccXJIF-No=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3NWUyNjdmNi1kZGViLTQ5YzEtODJiYi1kM2Y5MzljYjhiNjBfMTM0NHg4OTYucG5n 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/ycQwXjcl8gRyfgk42HNT6PYZS7zbjn3cpHQIu_mnrCw=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3NWUyNjdmNi1kZGViLTQ5YzEtODJiYi1kM2Y5MzljYjhiNjBfMTM0NHg4OTYucG5n 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/kAk4exs65cE5LXoHc0DXRoafjmAqFuynD68R0u5QkP8=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNzVlMjY3ZjYtZGRlYi00OWMxLTgyYmItZDNmOTM5Y2I4YjYwXzEzNDR4ODk2LnBuZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/iGmUW3B05sOGCg6F4ctFa6_1TjrMrsDrmIO39vLmTyk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNzVlMjY3ZjYtZGRlYi00OWMxLTgyYmItZDNmOTM5Y2I4YjYwXzEzNDR4ODk2LnBuZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure><p>While there may be some simple algorithm for general intelligence, the abundance of human-generated data and the exponential growth in computation makes “brute forcing” AGI through human emulation the most likely path forward, and certainly the one the tech industry is optimized for.

While LLMs have arguably surpassed weaker versions of the Turing Test already, the criterion of <em>indistinguishability </em>remains profoundly useful, especially when formalized mathematically.</p><p><a href="https://www.secondbest.ca/p/why-agi-is-closer-than-you-think?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share</a></p><h2><strong>The view from information theory</strong></h2><p>In information theory, minimizing the distinguishability between two distributions is equivalent to minimizing the “cross entropy loss.” Cross entropy is the average number of bits required to tell two data streams apart. Minimizing the cross entropy loss thus means increasing the number of bits needed to distinguish between two distributions. This is the essence of how machine learning models are trained. In a report for EpochAI, Matthew Barnett and Tamay Besiroglu use this fact to build the <a href="https://epochai.org/blog/the-direct-approach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Direct Approach</a> model, which is perhaps our best information-theoretic forecast of when an AI model will, in principle, be able to emulate human-level performance over long sequences of tasks.</p><p>The Direct Approach model combines the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14891" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">AI scaling laws</a> – the empirical fact that model performance increases as a smooth power law with more data, parameters, and training compute – with projected trends in training inputs, such as the availability of computing resources and improvements to hardware and algorithmic efficiency. Along with an estimate of the average number of tokens a human would need to discriminate between human and machine performance, the model yields an upper bound on the training compute required to automate a task at human level. It’s an upper bound because, as the authors explain,</p><blockquote><p>[A]t a certain point, the model might be trained more efficiently by directly getting reward signals about how well it’s performing on the task. This is analogous to how a human learning to play tennis might at first try to emulate the skills of good tennis players, but later on develop their own technique by observing what worked and what didn’t work to win matches.</p></blockquote><p>Benchmarked to the task of generating an original scientific manuscript that’s <em>indistinguishable </em>from one written by an expert human, the <a href="https://epochai.org/blog/direct-approach-interactive-model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">baseline Direct Approach model</a> suggests a transformative AI training run will require on the order of 10^32 FLOPs, with a median forecast of TAI by 2036 and a modal forecast of 2029.

If we can agree that the brain is a physical system with a certain computational capacity, sufficiently powerful computers with sufficiently sample-efficient neural networks should eventually be able to squeeze all the relevant entropy out of human generated data and asymptotically approach an ideal human emulator. The model thus gives a sense of how soon we’ll be able to “brute force” a human emulator given what we know about model scaling and the laws of thermodynamics.</p><p>Neural networks are “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10077" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">universal function approximators</a>,” meaning they can approximate arbitrary continuous functions on a compact set.

Yet this property only guarantees that a neural network for emulating the brain exists, not that it’s efficient to learn. The Direct Approach model helps bridge this gap by showing that functional approximation of human-level intelligence is not just possible in theory, but should be doable within the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>While there is plenty of uncertainty and room to quibble, this is a fundamentally conservative estimate, as our growing knowledge of the human brain and the interpretability of neural networks means we can do better than brute force.

GANs are trained to discriminate between real and fake data by going head-to-head against a model trained to generate increasingly good fakes – a kind of unsupervised, iterative Turing Test. At some point, the fake data becomes so hard to discriminate from the real data that it’s reasonable to assume the generator model learned the essential features of the real distribution.</p><p>GANs are commonly used to generate <a href="https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">synthetic images of people</a> that look indistinguishable from real photos. They do this by not merely copy and pasting from the training data, but by discovering circuits for detecting increasingly subtle facial features. New faces can then be generated by composing and interpolating between those features.</p><p>Human visual perception is based on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/408385v1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">deep neural networks</a> that work similarly. The presence of specialized feature detectors in our visual cortex explains why we excel at telling human faces apart, for example, while the faces of non-human animals like sheep all tend to look the same.

Of this, as little as 8% of our DNA is actually functional, while only 20,000 genes are responsible for all of protein-coding. This makes the genome an absurdly sparse model of the organism it’s used to build.

The reason relates to the thermodynamics of information. Changing a bit of information takes energy, so reducing the error in a model requires producing some amount of heat – there’s no free lunch.

Finding low complexity programs thus requires brute search, which manifests in machine learning as “grokking.” Grokking is when a machine learning model rapidly reaches zero training error by overfitting its parameters (i.e. memorizing the data), only to exhibit <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N6WM6hs7RQMKDhYjB/a-mechanistic-interpretability-analysis-of-grokking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">a sudden phase change</a> in generalization ability when training is allowed to run for longer.

From the big bang to the first transistor, getting to our advanced civilization required passing through a long series of “<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JdjxcmwM84vqpGHhn/great-filter-hard-step-math-explained-intuitively" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">hard steps</a>.” This included having a habitable planet replete with complex organic molecules; the abiogenesis of the first chemical replicators; the evolution of multicellularity, sexual reproduction, and the nervous system; the oxygenation of earth’s atmosphere; the emergence of warm blooded animals with complex social lives; the settlement of early human societies; the agricultural revolution and beyond. Each of these steps was deeply improbable, but with trillions of planets and billions of years to work with, they were also inevitable.</p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff44c9aad-ec32-463f-a223-58cbe4bf213c_813x531.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/-lf1zR1MUhYnQt46AU1Sg_HTsep0WdvGS2DhbGixn8g=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZmNDRjOWFhZC1lYzMyLTQ2M2YtYTIyMy01OGNiZTRiZjIxM2NfODEzeDUzMS5wbmc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Nfs4UhAALTfueaGWe3Dy_KfExQv3z-yq1vktF6z5nkk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZmNDRjOWFhZC1lYzMyLTQ2M2YtYTIyMy01OGNiZTRiZjIxM2NfODEzeDUzMS5wbmc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/hFtkBkrjzVMPAJdenPmesT3FRWX6nqp9zTEwZLWynzc=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGZjQ0YzlhYWQtZWMzMi00NjNmLWEyMjMtNThjYmU0YmYyMTNjXzgxM3g1MzEucG5n 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/NQuBlcYxw0YBHnoYsMancO0OuUk6HDQU6_tovSGJtzc=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGZjQ0YzlhYWQtZWMzMi00NjNmLWEyMjMtNThjYmU0YmYyMTNjXzgxM3g1MzEucG5n 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/zKqWoGMY2sCqOWgkYELKhRve3jI3C0ahWSC6Gz3Pcz0=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGZjQ0YzlhYWQtZWMzMi00NjNmLWEyMjMtNThjYmU0YmYyMTNjXzgxM3g1MzEucG5n" width="500" alt="" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/O6FSvm-0U275DwufvvWABQpqN7lHXVK99znISVMoBfw=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZmNDRjOWFhZC1lYzMyLTQ2M2YtYTIyMy01OGNiZTRiZjIxM2NfODEzeDUzMS5wbmc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/BdO1cy_TlLW8bjUqY4KZzyuG8p0-q1kBScjafsT6Sb0=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZmNDRjOWFhZC1lYzMyLTQ2M2YtYTIyMy01OGNiZTRiZjIxM2NfODEzeDUzMS5wbmc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/IuwcXIBvDllmAmmd5DxmpXkOPqy-3irq_Hv7zmU1pdU=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGZjQ0YzlhYWQtZWMzMi00NjNmLWEyMjMtNThjYmU0YmYyMTNjXzgxM3g1MzEucG5n 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/zKqWoGMY2sCqOWgkYELKhRve3jI3C0ahWSC6Gz3Pcz0=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGZjQ0YzlhYWQtZWMzMi00NjNmLWEyMjMtNThjYmU0YmYyMTNjXzgxM3g1MzEucG5n 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Cumulative probability of life emerging within a fixed, co-moving part of the universe as a function of cosmic time and for given solar masses.

For life to begin at all, the universe had to cool down, form stars, create heavy elements through supernovae, and settle into galaxies and solar systems without too much radiation. The universe is expected to only get <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-universe-becoming-more-habitable-180959972/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">more habitable</a> going forward as it continues to cool, leaving many life-supporting planets orbiting dwarf stars for trillions of years. Taking all of this into consideration, life on earth emerged almost as soon as life in the universe could realistically emerge anywhere. This provides a simple solution to the <a href="https://grabbyaliens.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Fermi Paradox</a>: the reason the universe isn’t littered with evidence of alien civilizations is because we’re still in the first cohort.</p><p>In short, intelligent life is inevitable because, with enough blind search and variation, nature eventually stumbles on rare, self-reinforcing processes for extracting entropy from the environment. This leads to take-off dynamics that pull nature into a new regime where the search for the next hard step begins anew. Thus, from the Cambrian explosion to the printing press to grokking, ours is a universe that makes hard things easy thanks to the universality of scaling laws and phase transitions.</p><p>With AGI around the corner, human civilization is about to go through another such transition – what Carl Shulman and others call the “<a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/carl-shulman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">intelligence explosion</a>.” If this still sounds improbable to you, it’s because it is. And yet nature finds a way.</p><p>Thanks for reading Second Best!

I’m confident that they <em>can</em>, as transformers are universal function approximators, but whether that’s the most efficient, long-run approach remains to be seen. More likely than not, I suspect AGI-level models will have a mixed architecture that combines the strengths and weaknesses of different model types. We’re already seeing versions of this through “<a href="https://blog.research.google/2022/11/mixture-of-experts-with-expert-choice.html?m=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">mixture of expert</a>” models, systems that use transformers as a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">semantic kernel</a>, and in models that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-chatgpt/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20a%20high%20level%20you%20can%20think%20of%20Gemini%20as%20combining%20some%20of%20the%20strengths%20of%20AlphaGo%2Dtype%20systems%20with%20the%20amazing%20language%20capabilities%20of%20the%20large%20models%2C%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">combine self-attention with reinforcement learning</a>. That said, while “no free lunch theorems” are pessimistic about a single AI model that can do everything, these theorems rest on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">fragile assumptions</a> that easily breakdown, suggesting a single learning algorithm may be indeed be “all we need.” The key point is to not let your 10 year forecast get too distracted by these near-term details, and to instead focus on what can be safely extrapolated from the universal properties of deep learning at scale <em>per se. </em>Whether or not scale is sufficient, it’s clearly necessary and by far the hardest step, as finding the best way to harness that scale reduces to an engineering and search problem with finite depth.</p><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-anchor-2">2</a><p>Note, I am not saying we need or should even want a 1 to 1 emulation of the human brain. Rather, we merely need a lossy compression of the intelligence latent in human data, and one that gets predictably less lossy with scale. Most of what the brain does isn’t relevant to AGI. Why emulate the part of the brain that controls digestion, say? We just need to simulate the models the brain uses for abstract thinking, creativity, reasoning, context awareness, etc. That&#39;s what LLMs are. We don&#39;t need granular brain scans. Language data itself contains significant latent information about the way language gets represented in the brain. If LLMs seem a bit alien, it’s because they&#39;re a superposition of lots of different kinds of language data produced by lots of different brains.</p><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-anchor-3">3</a><p>Note AGI is not the same thing as Artificial Superintelligence. Human-level AIs will be automatically super human in many respects, but not arbitrarily so. The same information-theoretic arguments that make near-term AGI plausible also put bounds on the plausibility of a runaway superintelligence, as a system with a given compute budget can only extract so much entropy from its training data and environment. That doesn’t make a “god-like” superintelligence impossible, but it does mean that we won’t get the true singularity until the requisite computing infrastructure is online, perhaps sometime in the 2040s.</p><a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-anchor-4">4</a><p>Scientists recently grew a live, biological neural network in the lab using a culture of in vitro human cortical cells. <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(22)00806-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627322008066%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">They then connected it to a virtual environment and it learned to play the game Pong</a>. Networks of cortical neurons thus appear to work just like an artificial neural network designed to spontaneously reduce the prediction error of its sensory-action feedback model of whatever environment it happens to be plugged into. </p><a id="footnote-5" href="#footnote-anchor-5">5</a><p>The key takeaway here is that our genetics aren’t a blueprint but rather the first input into a multi-level developmental process that’s guided by cybernetic attractors. This ensures our development is robust to perturbations and greatly simplifies the fitness landscape that evolution searches over. Thus, if an embryo spontaneously splits in two, it will grow into two perfectly well formed monozygotic twins. We’re similarly protected from a useful genetic mutation inadvertently giving us eyeballs on our elbows, as our morphological development is guided by attractors that are hard to knock off course, and thus in some sense shielded from natural selection. For a great overview of this, see Michael Levin’s recent talk on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CMh-9bAL4s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Emergent Selves and Unconventional Intelligences</a>.” The relevance to this post is that you don’t need to understand every step of an insanely complex process to reproduce it. Provided it’s based on simple principle, you just need the right initial conditions and sets of constraints to let the process unfold itself by rolling down an energy gradient. </p><a id="footnote-6" href="#footnote-anchor-6">6</a><p>I’m using the term “gradient descent” to loosely refer to any optimization algorithm that randomly searches a fitness landscape to find gradual improvements. If anything, natural selection is a <a href="https://joramkeijser.github.io/2022/05/01/mutations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">dumber learning algorithm</a> than the form of gradient descent used in machine learning, as gradient descent looks for the <em>steepest</em> improvement while evolution just selects for any mutation that improves the inclusive fitness of a single organism. Machine learning models also have a fixed loss function, whereas the definition of “fitness” in the evolutionary context is a moving target that changes with the environment. </p><a id="footnote-7" href="#footnote-anchor-7">7</a><p>To be precise, models seem to memorize the data first and then slowly build the circuits needed for generalization. The “grokking” phase change only occurs once the subnetworks for generalization are in place, letting it suddenly “prune” all the parameters it had been wasting on memorization. In other words, “<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8GZxtu46Kx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">grokking corresponds to sparsification</a>.”</p>
