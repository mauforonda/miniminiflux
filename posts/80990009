<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sometimes we make some mistakes when posting to Broadstreet with WordPress. The post on the Broadstreet blog is correct today — it shows Leander Heldring as the author of the post The Origins of Government and the State. But when the post is delivered directly into people’s email boxes, it shows the post coming from me.</p>
<p>I uploaded everything, but please be assured that this is Leander’s post and his work being discussed. I apologize to Leander. To see the post accurately, please click on the on the link below.</p>
<p>With apologies,</p>
<p>Jeff Jenkins</p>
