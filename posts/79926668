<p>Submitted by Kelsey with the following comment: &#34;The piece itself offers dense information, easily digestible, about mapping indigenous places in the face of encroachment by capital and Palm Oil plantations. Forests are instrumental to &#39;seeing like a state,&#39; and what I like best about this quote is that it offers an alternative, that aerial views can reveal to people what remains of a world beset by the machine of capital.&#34;</p>

<p>I listened to the audiobook of this book this week (great reading by Eunice Wong!). The humid southeast Asian archipelago setting and its sometimes fever dream paranoia/spy thriller-y moments were well-suited to lying in a bathtub with a fever.</p>

<p>I decided to read this after listening to Ruff on an episode of <a href="https://www.ouropinionsarecorrect.com/shownotes/2023/6/29/episode-133-silicon-valley-vs-science-fiction-ayn-rand?utm_source=perfectsentences&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=perfect-sentences-28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Our Opinions Are Correct</a> about Ayn Rand&#39;s legacy as Silicon Valley&#39;s most beloved sci-fi writer. It&#39;s pretty silly, like there&#39;s a mix of Vonnegut-style weirdness for weirdness sake and sort of no-nonsense New York-ness that reminds me of Thomas Pynchon&#39;s <em>Bleeding Edge</em>. </p>

<p>Patricia Lockwood writing about David Foster Wallace is a real gift, one that helped me think about my own ambivalent relationship to his work (I wrote a little about this in a Perfect Sentences highlighting Lauren Oyler&#39;s Goop cruise essay, which Lockwood also mentions). Some more highlights:</p>
<h2>All of them carry, as if in briefcases, their own small, sensuously specific details.</h2>
<h2>Whether he’s living up to his potential, to his regional titles, bending and trimming himself like a boy bonsai, sleeping at night with his talent in a pair of vaselined gloves.</h2>
<h2>The book is the thing that will not let you leave the house, because it might let you write it that day.</h2>
<p><em>As someone currently trying to Write Something, this particularly stung!!</em></p>
<h2>Whole books seemed to blink in and out with the cursor of some highlighted line.</h2>
<h2>We had first thought of him in terms of his genius, and then in terms of his suffering – how to hold these things in the same hand as his threat?</h2>
