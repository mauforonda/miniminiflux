CharacterAI allows users to chat with personality chatbots like Elon Musk to fictional characters like Super Mario. For context, it has the highest DAU/MAU ratio for all consumer AI apps.</p><h2>What’s going on here?</h2><p>CharacterAI launched Group Chats - A new way for users to interact with multiple AI characters together in group chats.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Df-1Fjp7faEATJ27cg6NAraBN_LWj-qanZ4idMRMEtI=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvZDc0OWMwYmQtNzRjMy00ZjA1LWFiMzItM2VkMWYyYTgyNGVmL2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>CharacterAI+ members can create Group Chats and invite other humans and characters into the group. The current limit is 5 humans and 5 characters per Group Chat. The feature is mobile only for now. The team at CharacterAI feels this is going one step closer to sci-fi interaction with humans. </p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>Group Chats enables new possibilities for collaborative storytelling, gameplaying, studying, and more. In comparison to solo chat, you can create language learning groups, a fictional world setting for your novel and a lot more.</p><p>The AI simulation demos are usually discarded as we’re not there yet. But these group chats could be the realistic version that is already here. And there’s little scepticism on adoption based on how engaged CharacteAI users are.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=0dd91b73-3f73-46eb-8d5f-85dba004df6a&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
