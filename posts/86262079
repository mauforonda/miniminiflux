<p>In preparation for moving to the US, I purchased traveller&#39;s health insurance for my wife and myself. This insurance doesn&#39;t cover preventative medicine, like yearly checkups and vaccines. I was prepared to pay out-of-pocket for the updated COVID vaccine until I heard about the CDC&#39;s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Bridge Access Program</a>. The program&#39;s website states, &#34;Adults 18 years and older without health insurance and adults whose health insurance does not cover all COVID-19 vaccine costs can get updated COVID-19 vaccines at no cost through the Bridge Access Program.&#34; However, it now seems less likely that my wife and I will get free vaccines under the program.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spoke with a pharmacist at a local CVS. He told me that he&#39;d received instructions not to bill the Bridge Access Program for vaccines given to people with health insurance, even if their insurance doesn&#39;t cover the vaccine. It sounded like CVS corporate had given all pharmacies these instructions. He mentioned that a connection at Rite Aid received similar guidelines. Walgreens also participates in the Bridge Access Program but I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve implemented the same rule.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps other people in my situation avoid sticker shock when they go to get vaccinated!</p>
