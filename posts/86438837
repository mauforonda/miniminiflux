This helps preserve the emotion, nuance, and identity of the original performance in the new language.</p><p>Creators can easily dub their content into multiple languages in their original voice, although there’s no lip sync. From quick tests, we also feel translations from English work better than compared to translations to English.</p><p>You can try uploading a sample audio/video or a URL to get a 1 minute dubbed result. Tip: Clear site cache and restart the browser to test multiple times.</p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>Voice dubbing for existing content is a big market. Spotify recently launched its Pilot program with OpenAI to dub podcasts. Spotify’s product is still not open for everyone—while anyone can use the Eleven Labs dubbing feature right now. </p><p>If you’re an indie maker who was building for the same problem with Eleven Labs in the backend, don’t stop. It’s easy to put off the project but the interface by Eleven Labs is geared toward general use cases. There is an opportunity to target niche use cases by solving edge cases (like lip sync).</p><p>The dubbing isn’t error-free, but if you&#39;re a creator, start experimenting now. Compare how your global audience reacts to AI translations compared to subtitles. This is the worst it’s going to be. </p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=322474d9-af92-468f-898e-58f83a60e482&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
