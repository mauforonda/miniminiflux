The assault, dubbed &#34;Operation Al-Aqsa Flood&#34; by Hamas, shocked Israelis and much of international community with its scope and brutality. Israel responded with overwhelming air and artillery strikes on Gaza, but has yet to send in ground forces.</p><p>It remains uncertain exactly how events will transpire over the coming weeks and months. To gain insight into how the conflict may proceed, we selected six forecasting questions on important factors that could characterize the conflict&#39;s trajectory over the next six months.

Still, as prolonged street-to-street fighting favors defenders, forecasters gave a 20% chance to Hamas retaining de facto control of Gaza City in six months&#39; time. Israel would likely face similar challenges as Iraq and the US-led coaltion had against ISIS in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mosul_(2016%E2%80%932017)?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mosul in 2016–17</a>. One forecaster&#39;s viewed the conditions as challenging for the Israel Defense Forces:</p><blockquote>It is very unclear to me how long it will take the IDF to clear Gaza of Hamas’s presence, given the IDF’s relatively mediocre performance in Lebanon in 2006 and again in Gaza in 2014. Urban combat has a long history of being extremely tough for the attacker against a well-prepared, dug-in foe, even when the attacker has a numerical and technological advantage.</blockquote><p>However, most forecasters assessed the chances of Israel achieving regime change in Gaza City within 6 months as highly likely. From the outset, everything said by those in charge in Israel leads one to believe that the chance of Hamas remaining in power for long is slim. As one forecaster explained, &#34;Initial reactions within Israel point strongly toward a &#39;gloves off&#39; response, and early comments from major allies appear — for the moment — to give Israel carte blanche.&#34;</p><p>Public resolve in Israel to defeat Hamas appears high after the trauma of recent attacks. Israel seems willing to bear substantial military and civilian costs to decisively end the threat posed by Hamas in Gaza City. As one analyst noted, &#34;It was never a question of capability of taking out Hamas in 2009 or 2014 but rather political will. Due to the situation today this is not a factor.&#34;</p><p>The challenges that forecasters cited for not providing probabilities closer to 0% were:</p><ul><li>Clearing tunnels street-by-street will likely take months, if that is how Israel choose to proceed.</li><li>Tanks will be vulnerable to ambushes.</li><li>Hamas&#39;s technological sophistication (including the effective use of drones) has improved, probably with Iran&#39;s help. <ul><li><em>(For more on the challenges of a ground invasion of Gaza, forecasters found <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/these-are-the-challenges-awaiting-israeli-ground-forces-in-gaza/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><em>this article</em></a> useful.)</em></li></ul></li><li>Wider conflict with Hezbollah could divert resources from the push into Gaza City.</li><li>Fully re-occupying Gaza City may not align with Israel&#39;s strategic objectives.</li></ul><p>Indeed, on that final points, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/world/europe/israel-gaza-ground-invasion.html?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">reports say there is little appetite</a> for reoccupation of Gaza. However, several forecasters do not believe it is out of the question. Israel occupied Gaza from 1967-1993, and partly until 2005.

While historical precedent might suggest this grim projection is unlikely, this situation appears fundamentally different to the past. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">2014 Gaza War</a> lasted 7 weeks and resulted in around 2,400 deaths. But Israel&#39;s goals then were limited to stopping rocket attacks, not removing Hamas from power. The fact that so many consider this situation to be &#34;Israel&#39;s 9/11&#34; suggests Israel will have an elevated willingness to absorb casualties to achieve decisive results.</p><p>Comparable sieges such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aleppo_(2012%E2%80%932016)?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Aleppo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Sarajevo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mariupol?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mariupol</a> provide mixed lessons. Their timescales range from several months to over four years, and their death tolls range from 14,000 to (possibly) 45,000. Forecasters believe Hamas is likely to fall faster than these examples, but its resistance could still prolong the conflict. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mosul_(2016%E2%80%932017)?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Battle of Mosul</a> remains the closest example to this current conflict; its death toll is highly uncertain (as this one&#39;s will be), with estimates ranging from 15,000 to 32,500 over 9 months.</p><h3 id="civilian-death-toll">Civilian death toll</h3><p>High civilian deaths are very likely given Gaza&#39;s dense population and Israel&#39;s willingness to use overwhelming firepower. Additionally, with Gaza under blockade and nowhere to escape to, civilian suffering is inevitable. The civilian death ratio in 2014 was around 70% according to Palestinian sources. Israel&#39;s current &#34;gloves off&#34; approach, combined with the 20% growth in Gaza&#39;s population since 2014, could produce similar or greater casualty ratios.</p><p>Exacerbating the situation is the misinformation persuading civilians not to listen to warnings about imminent attacks. As a humanitarian measure, Israel issues advance warnings to Gaza residents advising them to evacuate specific buildings that have been identified as targets for airstrikes. However, Gaza news outlets actively urge residents to ignore them. On Wednesday, Gaza Now posted on X to say &#34;Since the beginning of the war... the Israeli occupation is trying to control Gaza by sending different codes and emails as if they are from official bodies. Once they are clicked on, our accounts are fully hacked. Thanks to God, our team is awake and is thwarting the repeated attempts of the occupation.

Please do not deal with these warnings at all. The occupation aims from these calls to create confusion and spread fear among our people in the streets of Gaza.&#34; (<a href="https://twitter.com/GNNANOW/status/1711900189223530925?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Link</a>)</p><p>This morning, Israel gave the unprecedented <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-c8b4fc20e4fd2ef381d5edb7e9e8308c?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">directive for 1.1 million civilians</a> living in Gaza City to evacuate to the south. While the Israeli military acknowledges the logistical challenge in relocating such a large number within a day, they attribute non-compliance to Hamas instructing residents to disregard the evacuation call.</p><p>While such an evacuation could result in fewer fatalities, the news caused forecasters to adjust their fatality projections upwards, as it signifies the intended strength of Israel&#39;s coming military response.

Here is one forecaster&#39;s reasoning for expecting a death toll of over 25,000 in Gaza:</p><blockquote>Base rates of number of casualties are useful for perspective, but this attack is unprecedented, with the highest number of Jews being killed in a single day since the Holocaust. This is very, very different from the previous operations in Gaza or even Lebanon. I think that Israel its government, its military and its society is very very serious about eliminating Hamas.</blockquote><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/senior-idf-commander-says-hamas-has-7000-rockets-dozens-of-drones/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">a senior Israeli commander estimated</a> Hamas&#39; strength in Gaza at around 30,000 fighters (though one forecaster points out that &#34;the definition of &#39;fighters&#39; is probably a loose one, ranging from committed jihadists willing to die all the way down to untrained militiamen with a rifle&#34;).</p><p>Historically, casualty ratios between the IDF and Hamas have been greatly skewed. The 2014 Gaza War saw 40 Palestinian militants die for every 1 Israeli soldier, so forecasters anticipate that losses among IDF will not make up a large proportion of the total death toll. They do expect the IDF will suffer a significantly higher number of losses than they have in previous conflicts, with one forecaster arguing the following:</p><blockquote>Israeli military casualties in the Gaza Strip could be quite high, as they could be vulnerable to ambushes and will be operating in an area where the civilian population is hostile to the Israeli military. Hamas&#39;s technological sophistication (including the effective use of drones) has also improved, probably with Iran&#39;s help. </blockquote><h3 id="pressures-to-de-escalate">Pressures to de-escalate</h3><p>One forecaster who expects the death toll to remain under 25,000 anticipates that pressure from the U.S. could prevent the death toll from climbing so high. Another forecaster sees Israel&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-warns-iran-over-gaza-israel-forms-emergency-war-cabinet-2023-10-11/?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAqDQgAKgYICjC3oAwwsCYwm5TPAg&amp;utm_content=rundown&amp;gaa_at=la&amp;gaa_n=AYRtylZzenyV0Si9Bq5SybZ3wlg94BPU9xgtzBPAiDce7kDHMafCiRapULHaBtrktZ3SQ4tyK3KIqimr7ZVQ4l9JpcdVoBl5CA%3D%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6528353e&amp;gaa_sig=CpYE1yzUCAotQQwdC4-qbVe-qFjZso-9NHk35pTi4GwLLxHbuxPt0HpWWd8aIsV--r--aAeSP7lNeFnvTRYVxQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">potential willingness to relax the Gaza blockade</a> as an indication that they may consider de-escalation.

There are conflicting reports on what, if anything, would lead to Hezbollah&#39;s entrance. The Lebanese Foreign Minister<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/lebanon-says-hezbollah-has-promised-not-to-join-war-unless-israel-harasses-country/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> claims that</a> Hezbollah would only enter if Israel attacks Lebanon (though Israel has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-its-troops-killed-gunmen-who-infiltrated-lebanon-2023-10-09/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">struck</a> Southern Lebanon).<br/><br/>Some, including the Iranian Foreign Minister and Hezbollah’s Deputy Leader, claim that Hezbollah would attack if Israel launches a ground assault on Gaza. Meanwhile, the US and Hezbollah <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-9-2023/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">have</a> been<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hezbollah-threatens-us-as-russia-sees-high-risk-of-3rd-party-entering-conflict/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> trading threats</a>, clearly trying to deter each other from getting involved. Hezbollah probably<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/09/hezbollah-lebanon-hamas-war-israel-iran/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> doesn&#39;t</a> want to get involved in a direct confrontation with the US. Still, it may be pushed further by Iran. Even if they do get involved, there&#39;s still a non-negligible probability that there wouldn&#39;t be 500 fatalities — some estimates<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> suggest</a> that there were fewer than 500 military fatalities during the 2006 Lebanon War; others suggest there were more.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the US&#39;s strong warnings for others not to get involved (exemplified by Biden&#39;s repeated statements to that effect) were more likely than not a sufficient deterrent, but with high uncertainty, and the statements from Iran’s Foreign Minister and Hezbollah suggest that they haven’t been deterred.</blockquote><p>Another forecaster emphasises Hezbollah&#39;s readiness to get involved:</p><blockquote>Hezbollah has stayed out of the war so far, but I&#39;m very uncertain what their overall plan is. It could be that they are waiting to see Israel invest significant resources in Gaza before attacking, and using the destruction that will be caused as a pretext.<br/><br/>I think this would be an unwise move for Hezbollah, as I&#39;m confident they&#39;d lose. Nevertheless, they may have as many as 150k missiles, so they have clearly been preparing for a situation like this.</blockquote><p>The forecaster who most strongly thinks this is unlikely over the next 6 months gave the following reasoning:</p><blockquote>I&#39;ve been surprised at how quiet things have been, if there were going to be a northern front. There was a tactical engagement resulting in the death of 3 Hezbollah fighters, along with a rocket barrage and Hezbollah <a href="https://english.almanar.com.lb/1923286?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">statement</a> threatening Israel, but otherwise it has been fairly quiet. Although Hezbollah and Hamas share a common enemy with Israel (and both are sponsored and supported by Iran), they have different geographical and political focuses, as well as Hezbollah being Shia while Hamas is Sunni. There is also the Iranian “crossroads of fire” concept, discussed by the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/09/iran-support-hamas-training-weapons-israel/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">here</a>, with the idea being to launch an attack on Israel every few months or years as a long-term campaign to sap its morale and viability. And so in the recent past, it&#39;s been more of a one-two punch with, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">July 2006 Israel-Lebanon War</a> coming a year after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Second Intifada</a>.<br/><br/>I would also note the fact that Iran has spent decades now expanding its influence in Syria and Lebanon, and to lose both its Gaza proxy and its Lebanon/Syria proxy would be an enormous destruction of its geopolitical influence. The US is moving the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean, adding further deterrence.</blockquote><h3 id="reasons-given-for-hezbollahs-involvement-in-the-conflict">Reasons given for Hezbollah&#39;s involvement in the conflict</h3><p>On the other hand, there were many reasons given by others for why Hezbollah would get involved:</p><blockquote>During the last ground invasion of Gaza by the IDF in 2014,<a href="https://medium.com/war-is-boring/these-are-the-israeli-units-fighting-in-gaza-c575c8ee3f8c?ref=swiftcentre.org#:~:text=Hezbollah%20is%20sitting,Arsal%20inside%20Lebanon." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> Hamas urged Hezbollah to join the fight and open the second front, but this didn&#39;t happen, likely because Hezbollah was then engaged in intense fighting in Syria</a>. This time, Hezbollah does not appear to be that much preoccupied elsewhere.</blockquote><blockquote>Israel and Hezbollah have been killing each other daily, but with some restraint. Once the ground war in Gaza starts, it will become increasingly difficult for Hezbollah to stay out of the heavy fighting. Their support comes from Iran and they have an extensive tunnel system of ~150,000 missiles and rockets. An unknown is whether the US will intervene with air power.</blockquote><blockquote>1) Israel would certainly be challenged to fight on two fronts at once, so Hezbollah might roll the dice even at risk of its destruction, if it sees a narrow window of opportunity.<br/>2) ISW<a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-9-2023?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> reports</a> that Hezbollah is moving fighters to southwest Syria [closer to Israel].<br/>3) Israeli forces are<a href="https://twitter.com/yoavzitun/status/1711017594705018920?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> reported</a> to be massed in the north. Of course, this also means Israeli assets are diverted and distracted without any fighting needing to happen. <br/>4) Recent<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/gallant-warns-multi-front-war-far-more-likely-for-israel-than-limited-conflicts/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> warnings</a> from Israel&#39;s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</blockquote><blockquote>Hamas&#39;s action only really make any sense as part of a coordinated plan involving Hezbollah to force the IDF to fight on two fronts, so at the least I expect some action from the IDF to deter Hezbollah from entering the conflict, and I also expect at the very least plenty of probing actions from Hezbollah. </blockquote><h3 id="making-the-most-of-mobilisation">Making the most of mobilisation?</h3><p>An alternative path to this question resolving positively was provided by another forecaster on a forecaster call. “If this goes reasonably well for Israel (i.e. they achieve their main objectives in a few weeks) you can see how they might think &#39;while we&#39;re fully mobilised - let&#39;s fully destroy Hezbollah now.&#39; It&#39;s a possibility, especially if we&#39;re talking about the next 6 months,&#34; the forecaster noted. “Some might think about occupying South Lebanon again,” they argued. Expanding on their thinking after the call:</p><blockquote>For all the differences between the two cases, the Israeli withdrawals from South Lebanon in 2000 and from Gaza in 2005 followed a similar logic: to reduce the burden of actively occupying areas that Israel does not deem vital (as opposed to the Golan or the Jordan Valley) and to take a mobilising cause for its enemies away.<br/><br/>The idea was that it would be possible to mostly seal off the borders, establish deterrence and protect oneself without exposing Israeli troops to permanent (potential) enemy contact.<br/><br/>It&#39;s hard to argue that these goals have been reached. In both cases, conflict is far greater than what we had seen in previous years (Lebanon 2006, Gaza 2008). </blockquote><p>They point out that Israel&#39;s image in the global public eye has not improved much, but they are seeing more support now. &#34;Now, the costs of occupying these areas and assuming full responsibility for many aspects of life there seems much more acceptable.&#34;</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>Swift forecasters selected six key questions as a basis for quantifying their beliefs about the current conflict between Israel and Hamas.

A successful forecasting strategy often involves adhering closely to these base rates, unless there is good reason to expect deviations. In this instance, forecasters&#39; predictions diverge significantly from the base rates: they assign an 80% chance to Hamas being ousted from Gaza City (after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance_of_the_Gaza_Strip?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ruling it for 16 years</a>), and a 56% chance of witnessing a death toll unprecedented in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict?ref=swiftcentre.org#Notable_wars_and_violent_events" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">past 75 years of the Arab-Israeli conflict</a>.</p><p>The remaining three questions are concerned with how the conflict may escalate internationally, and will be covered in our second report on the topic this weekend.</p><a href="#/portal/signup/free">Subscribe</a><p><em>Illustration by <a href="https://laurelmolly.co.uk/?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><em>Laurel Molly</em></a> ©</em></p>
