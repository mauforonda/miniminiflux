<p>Alice Marwick joined the New Books Network‚Äôs <strong><a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/the-private-is-political" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">podcast on Science, Technology, and Society</a></strong> to talk about <em>The Private is Political</em>. She talked about <strong><a href="https://citap.substack.com/p/the-private-is-political" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">networked privacy</a></strong> with host Jake Chanenson, who also asked about the feminist history of privacy covered in the book.</p><p>The legal concept of privacy traces its roots to an 1890 Harvard Law Review article by future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and Samuel D. Warren. Drawing on work by Dr. Anita L. Allen, <em>The Private is Political</em> explores how that concept relies on gendered notions of separate private and public spheres. As Alice summarized it on the podcast:</p><blockquote><p>I was really inspired when I read Anita Allen&#39;s original piece ‚Äú<a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2309&amp;context=faculty_scholarship" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">How Privacy Got Its Gender</a>‚Äù, which looks at how one of the most cited law review articles of all time, ‚ÄúThe Right to Privacy,‚Äù the Brandeis article. And this article is very much steeped in sort of what we might think of as Gilded Age norms, where there was a upper-middle-class ideal of the private sphere and the public sphere that was very gendered. It was rooted in the cult of true womanhood, which was, again, an upper-middle-class, white, obviously Northeastern ideal that women were the guardians of the domestic sphere of the home, that they held on to morality, that they were responsible for inculcating their husbands and children into this morality.</p><p>But as part of that, they weren&#39;t supposed to participate in public life. So what Anita Allen does in her piece is she shows how these gendered norms played really deeply into the Brandeis piece and the modern concept of the right to privacy. And that when we think about who is entitled to privacy, it was people who were moving from the domestic sphere into the public sphere, which was men. And again, these norms are really specific. People of color, women of color, and white women have very different expectations of privacy in the public and private spheres. Even for white women, if they were ensconced in the home, that home could be a place of surveillance, it could be a place of abuse, it could be a place where they didn&#39;t enjoy ‚Äúa man&#39;s home is his castle,‚Äù this idea of ultimate privacy. A lot of people are surveilled and watched within their houses. And at the time, even though there were lots of women like domestic workers and women who worked in factories and things like that, for upper middle-class women, there was this assumption that you didn&#39;t work outside the home. And so there wasn&#39;t access to the public sphere.</p><p>By breaking all of this down, we see that a lot of the early privacy legislation was really concerned with a violation of genteel women&#39;s privacy. It was about ‚Äúshould portraits of women be used on advertising,‚Äù ‚Äúcan newspapers print pictures of socialites,‚Äù things like that. And what you end up seeing is that some of the earliest privacy legislation is supposed to protect the gentility and domesticity of women. But there were a lot of very innovative, perhaps, or spirited women who did not live their life in adherence to these norms, who were able to sort of use those stereotypes to their own benefit by saying, ‚Äúwell, look, I am a modest woman, you can&#39;t use my visage in in this product, because it would violate my modesty,‚Äù even if really, they didn&#39;t want it done for a variety of other reasons. And I think that these gendered and racist assumptions about privacy have continued through the ages, even as our conceptions of privacy has changed.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/the-private-is-political" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Listen to the episode</a></p><p><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300229622/the-private-is-political/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Get the book</a></p><h2>Publications and appearances</h2><p>‚ÄúThe dead make up a surprisingly large portion of the internet‚Äôs population ‚Äî on Facebook alone, dead users are expected to outnumber the living by 2070.
