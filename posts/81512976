    <h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>I’m an artist, writer, cartoonist, animation director and a teacher. As the first woman to work for DC Comics AND Marvel simultaneously, I was one of the founding mommies of <em>Wimmen’s Comix</em>. An Inkpot Award winner and an Eisner Award nominee, I&#39;m best known for her <em>Pudge</em>, <em>Girl Blimp series</em> (1974-1978), now out as a book (2016). Currently my adventure series, <em>Sondra of the Secret Service</em>, written by Nicky Wheeler-Nicholson, is available on Aces Weekly, a <a href="https://www.acesweekly.co.uk/" title="David&#39;s web comics site." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">web comics site</a> of David Lloyd’s. A contributor to the Eisner Award-winning <em>Drawing Power</em> (edited by Diane Noomin, 2019), and <em>Covid Chronicles: A Comics Anthology</em> (edited by Kendra Boileau and Rich Johnson, 2021), my future-released work includes “Lifeblood Driving” in <em>World War 3 Illustrated</em>, and “Food for Thought” in <em>Let’s Bet the Planet</em>.</p>

<p>An Emmy Award winner, I ran digital design and animation company Lee Marrs Artwork for 30 years. I&#39;m the retired Multimedia Chair of Berkeley City Colleges, Berkeley CA.</p>

<h3>And what software?</h3>

<p>For graphics, I originally used Oasis, then I participated in the Knoll brothers’ development graphics software for Barneyscan in the early ‘90s. That became <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" title="A bitmap image editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Photoshop</a>. Once Adobe Photoshop became available for Apple products, I signed on and it’s been my drug of choice. I use <a href="https://www.apple.com/keynote/" title="Presentation software for the Mac." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Keynote</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" title="An audio recording and editing tool for the Mac." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">GarageBand</a> for presentations and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" title="A document editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail" title="Web-based email." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Gmail</a>.</p>

<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>My dream setup would be Hawaii, on a hill, on an open porch, with an endless Mai Tais... uh... I’m actually almost there, with a sunny converted garage as my studio. But I wish the outside view was an ocean with waving palms instead of my backyard</p>
