<p><em>The Verge</em> decided to select the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23771068/best-tech-books-nonfiction-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">best non-fiction books about technology of all time</a>. As they put it, </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Technology craves a narrative but often has a short memory for history. As a publication that contributes to that — The Verge lives in the news cycle, after all — we wanted to praise the form of writing that lasts: the book. How else do we move forward if we can’t remember the past? So we set out with the audacious goal to define the best books about tech out there. …If the modern tech landscape is defined by obsolescence, then we wanted to celebrate the books about it that have stood the test of time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No small task. And there are some excellent books on the list. But the SMC was particularly excited to see that they included two books from two scholars who we were lucky enough to have join us — <em>Distributed Blackness: African American Cybercultures</em> (NYU) by André Brock Jr, who visited us for a semester, and <em>New Money: How Payment Became Social Media</em> (Yale) by Lana Swartz, who was once our postdoc. We know these two books and these two scholars are notable, but were excited when others notice too. Congrats, Lana and André! </p>
