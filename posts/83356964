    <h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Hi! I&#39;m <a href="https://psychewilliamsforson.com/" title="Dr. Psyche&#39;s website." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Dr. Psyche Williams-Forson</a>, aka Dr. Psyche, aka Dr. PWF, and what I do is profess to know stuff about food, gender, race, class, and culture, especially material culture like food and foodways of people throughout the African Diaspora. I’m a writer and a thinker, and I also get paid to chair a department at the University of Maryland College Park. That’s what I do. Who I am is a daughter, a friend, and a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. I’m really also a PhDMom, aka a part-time photographer (or is this my real job?) for my young adult daughter. Because if she is with me, I’m taking her picture - on portrait and landscape - thanks iPhone.</p>

<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" title="A laptop." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MacBook Pro</a>. And, I’ve been corralled into an iPhone by said daughter because “Mom, now we can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime" title="Mac and iOS software for easy video chatting." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">FaceTime</a>” and, of course, take better pictures. Said iPhone is also my go-to for listening to books on tape (thank you, local library <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/libby-by-overdrive/id1076402606" title="An app for borrowing ebooks from libraries." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Libby app</a>) and for meetings, keeping my calendar, checking email, and conducting all kinds of impromptu interviews. Because you never know when a family member or friend will launch into a new story that is usable. When I super have my act together, I use a <a href="https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h1n-handy-recorder/" title="A portable audio recorder." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Zoom H1N Handy Recorder</a>, with a one-touch button and a <a href="https://shop.vidprousa.com/collections/microphones/products/new-vidpro-xm-l-professional-lavalier-condenser-microphone" title="A lavalier micrphone." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">VidPro Lavalier condenser microphone</a>, because the voice recorder app is not reliable. After doing yet another podcast in what looks like a dark tunnel, I was convinced of the need to buy a Weilisi 10” ring light. They wanted me to buy three but do I need that much light?</p>

<p>I backup everything relentlessly with a <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/external-drives/wd-elements-desktop-usb-3-0-hdd" title="An external hard drive." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">2 TB WD Elements external hard drive</a> and I thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Mac_OS)" title="Backup software for the masses, included with Mac OS X 10.5." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Time Machine</a> for the constant reminders of my dereliction. A wonky large LG flatscreen TV gives me access to lots of pop culture fodder, and a smaller, wonkier one does the same in my home office. I live on the edge with both Verizon cable (software?) and an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230130044925/https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-With-Alexa-Voice-Remote-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B00ZV9RDKK/" title="A device for streaming media to a TV." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a>, with no usable remote - enter said iPhone and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-fire-tv/id947984433" title="An app for controlling a Fire TV device." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Fire TV app</a>. My ultimate, can’t live without hardware, are my many bookshelves - maybe 6 or so that hold my books, all of which I have held in my hands, even if I have not read them in all in full.</p>

<h3>And what software?</h3>

<p>I’m a Google user, although I hate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail" title="Web-based email." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Gmail</a>. Bring back <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-business" title="An email, calendar and contact software suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Outlook</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs" title="A web-based office suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Docs</a> and Google tabs compete for space on multiple email accounts. When I need to scan something in a pinch, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-scanner-pdf-scanner-app/id1635527089" title="A document scanner app." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Tiny Scan</a> comes in clutch. Then I use the usual - <a href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat.html" title="Software for creating and editing PDF documents." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Adobe Acrobat</a> and Microsoft suite - mostly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" title="A document editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Word</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint" title="Presentation software." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">PowerPoint</a>. I hate <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel" title="A spreadsheet application." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Excel</a> but will use it when the business people need me to read a file or three. To send large video and visual files I use <a href="https://www.hightail.com/" title="A service for securely sending files." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Hightail</a> or Google, both get the job done well. Hightail is also great for sending secure docs. These days, grad students will text me so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMessage" title="A messaging platform." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">iMessage</a> is key, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger" title="An instant messaging service." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Facebook Messenger</a>. Zoom has replaced <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" title="Voice and video chat software." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Skype</a> in my world of things and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" title="An intelligent personal assistant service." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Siri</a> comes in when you need the handsfree option. When I’m writing, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221227052606/https://www.grammarly.com/" title="A writing and grammar service." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Grammarly</a> is amazing, and annoying, at the same time. And though I’m still trying to find the best way to manage citations, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/" title="A research tool." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Zotero</a> is a frontrunner for my next project to organize my data.</p>

<p>To keep my sanity, I use game apps - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spades-plus-card-game/id834185106" title="A card game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spades Plus</a> rules! But also <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/royal-match/id1482155847" title="A match-3 game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Royal Match</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropdom-jigsaw-puzzle/id1450580739" title="A jigsaw puzzle game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Dropdom</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woody-battle-2-multiplayer-pvp/id1534846131" title="A PvP block battle game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Woody Battle 2</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uno/id1344700142" title="A multiplayer card game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Uno</a>. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gin-rummy/id338402947" title="A card game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Gin Rummy</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/match-triple-3d-matching-tile/id1530876832" title="A matching puzzle game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Match Triple 3D</a> - I probably should be embarrassed at the number of games I play but I’m not. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/words-with-friends/id322852954" title="A word game for the iPhone." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Words with Friends 1</a> just gave me two words that scored 549 points and 446 points and now I’m on a mission, which really is just a matter of some well-placed high point value tiles. I can do this!!!! <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/match-masters-pvp-match-3/id1138264921" title="A PvP match-3 game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Match Masters</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toy-blast/id890378044" title="A puzzle game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Toy Blast</a> work when I’m flying and nothing else will talk to Southwest WiFi. I have to play at least a game of Spades (best out of three), before I can start working. It’s a ritual that started in graduate school along with early morning meditation via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" title="A web site for watching 80&#39;s TV commercials and bad mashups." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="A jukebox application and online store." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">iTunes</a> to ground myself and prepare for the craziness of the day. And when I want to work deeply, I need <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221226033709/https://www.netflix.com/" title="A movie rental and streaming service." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Netflix</a> for background noise, though Prime and BritBox do a great job of providing necessary visual sustenance.</p>

<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>A corner condo unit overlooking the Potomac. I want to be a minimalist but my life as a material culturalist screams maximalist. Like, why am I thinking about getting a workstation desk bike? Because I just don’t have enough unused exercise stuff in my house (I really don’t) but THIS, THIS I will use, especially in my dream space, which will have lots of room for me to fill with “stuff.”</p>
