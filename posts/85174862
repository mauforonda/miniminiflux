This article discusses how Greeks perceived Salvador Allende&#39;s overthrow, Pinochet&#39;s military dictatorship, and US interventionism in Chile. By the end of Greece&#39;s dictatorship (1967–1974), left‐wing militants emotionally identified with the ‘Chilean tragedy’ through their own experiences of military authoritarianism. Indeed, the Greek Colonels&#39; Junta amplified the 1973 Chilean coup&#39;s local impact. Subsequently, during the early Metapolitefsi period (1974–1981), a wide variety of Greek political, social, and cultural actors used the Chilean 1970s as a key reference in the crucial debates that ultimately redefined Greece&#39;s collective political and cultural identities.
