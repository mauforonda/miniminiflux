<h6>Is there a right historical analogy for Gaza 2023?; the spreadsheet job apocalypse; how is the human brain special?; very briefly noted; lots of people on Claudia Goldin, Dan Wang on China&#39;s scale &amp; product expertise, Christopjer es Jones &amp; Benjamin Wittes on the terrorists of Hamas, Twitter goes all-in on spam, yes there are professional Republicans who think Donald Trump is a fashion plate, Katie Martin on the bond-market mincing machine, Josh Barro vainly pleads with Republicans; &amp; I briefly note things…</h6><h2>MUST-READ: Is There a Right Historical Analogy for Gaza 2023?:</h2><p>Which is the right analogy for what is going to happen now? First Fallujah, Second Fallujah, or something else?:</p><p>For years long-time Israeli Prime Minister pursued a strategy of funding and boosting Hamas, with the idea that a stronger Hamas meant a weaker Fatah, and thus made resisting calls for a Palestinian state more possible. Now it has blown up in his face. As I see it, he wants to keep his job and cannot do so without at least trying to destroy Hamas as a government, as a network, and as an ideology. 40,000 IDF soldiers, 2 million Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and an unknown number of Hamas terrorists and militants.</p><p>Was the Hamas plan to cross the border, attack some military bases, seize some hostages, and hightail it back? Or was the plan to kill as many civilians as possible in order to make it impossible for the IDF to not pursue into the urban soon-to-become-a-hellscape that is Gaza? I do not know. I suspect the second.</p><p>So what happens now as the IDF goes into Gaza?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Christopher W. Jones</strong>: ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/cwjones89/status/1711093468737503302" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">From Anwar Sadat up to the present</a>… normalization has always been a triangular calculation recognizing the unlikelihood of military victory over Israel versus the economic benefits of peace with Israel and improved relations with the USA. Against the slow tide… Hamas and Hezbollah have always argued &#34;no, armed struggle can still work, just give us a chance.&#34; But winning is the only thing that makes this argument convincing. Tension arises because projecting victimhood—the most successful Palestinian diplomatic strategy—requires <em>not</em> winning.</p><p>Hamas had to choose one route or the other, and chose to go full ISIS. But how is slaughtering hundreds of civilians winning?… They&#39;ve hurt Israel. That&#39;s what matters. This is the &#34;resistance&#34; that many are euphemistically posting about today. Will it provoke a massive Israeli response? Certainly. Will it undermine Palestinian diplomatic standing in the West. Yes. Does this matter? Not as long as Hamas&#39; government in Gaza survives…. </p><p>I see many comments calling this a suicide mission by Hamas. This is based on the assumption that Hamas will inevitably lose if the IDF embarks on a full invasion of Gaza. That is not an assumption that should be made. Hezbollah fought the IDF to a draw in 2006.. Hamas has been steadily increasing its military capabilities, gaining experience from every war. They have had over a decade and a half to prepare the ground. New tech such as drones and ATGMs heavily favor the defender. A conventional battlefield victory by Hamas inside Gaza is entirely possible. I don&#39;t think the Hamas leadership would have launched yesterday&#39;s attack if they thought otherwise…</p></blockquote><p>What is going to be the ratio of Hamas leader and foot-soldier deaths to Palestinian civilian deaths? What is going to be the ratio of Hamas leader and foot-soldier deaths to IDF soldier deaths? And how long and far will Israel push the death and destruction as it executes its just war against Hamas—a just war as long as it takes due care to reduce collateral civilian casualties? And will civilian casualties mount so high that Israel’s war on Hamas will seek to be a just one. A just war, after all, has to be one that produces a better rather than a worse situation—even if your cause is just, your war is not unless it can also be justified on utilitarian grounds.</p><p>This was horrible on Saturday as Hamas’s terrorists wreaked murder. This is more horrible now. This is going to get more horrible still.</p><p><a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/subscribe?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Subscribe now</a></p><h2>ONE IMAGE: Technology &amp;
