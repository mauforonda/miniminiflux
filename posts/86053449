Canva is capturing this by modifying the models to their target audience’s need i.e. making design and images, often in a professional space, quickly without learning heavy tools. </p><p>This levels the playing field in design. Novices can make pro-level content quickly without technical skills. The AI features automate the busywork like finding a relevant stock image, recreating in different sizes and more so you can focus on communicating your idea.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=8906c3dd-63eb-4293-8bfd-7a600ba2548b&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
