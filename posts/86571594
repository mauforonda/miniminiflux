<p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>Today let’s talk about a novel way of accessing generative artificial intelligence that, I think, speaks to how all of us are going to be using it in the future — and the feeling of vertigo I get when I think through the implications of this shift for the internet more broadly.</p><p>Last month, I was speaking with some people who work on AI safety. We discussed the difference between using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, which is free to all, and GPT-4, which costs $20 a month. </p><p>I had recently subscribed to ChatGPT Plus at the encouragement of a friend who had found it to be an excellent tutor in biology. A few days later, I found myself embarrassed: what I thought I knew about the state of the art had essentially been frozen a year ago when ChatGPT was first released. Only by using the updated model did I see how much better it performed at tasks involving reasoning and explanation.</p><p>I told the researcher I was surprised by how quickly my knowledge had gone out of date. Now that I had the more powerful model, the disruptive potential of large language models seemed much more tangible to me. </p><p>The researcher nodded. “You can fast forward through time by spending money,” she said. </p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/developer-productivity-tools-startup-raycast-raises-15m-from-accel-and-coatue/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">a pair of former Facebook software engineers named Thomas Paul Mann and Petr Nikolaev founded Raycast</a>. The company’s app, which is currently <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">only available for Mac</a>, is a launcher: an app you use to do things with other apps.</p><p>If you have used <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/search-with-spotlight-mchlp1008/mac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spotlight</a> on your Mac, or more sophisticated tools like Alfred or the late lamented Quicksilver, you are familiar with the basics of what Raycast can do. You type a universal hotkey, such as ⌘+space, and a window pops up on your screen. Type a few letters (“c-h-r”), and Raycast will guess what you are trying to do: in this case, open Chrome. </p>
