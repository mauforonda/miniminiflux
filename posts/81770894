<p>This essay is from 2019 but I went to go re-read it after encountering essentially an academic journal retread of its entire premise (they did, at least, cite Haskins). This was almost certainly the reason I started following Haskins&#39; reporting (she&#39;s now at <em>Insider</em>, mostly doing surveillance-related stuff that&#39;s much more Serious Investigative Impactful type reporting which is cool though I do kind of hope she gets to do weird shit like this again someday). I know when people pull up my old work I end up cringing a lot but I hope she&#39;s still proud of this. </p>

<p>This essay seems to have been controversial or at least divisive to people in my timelines. Beyond being obviously mentally ill I have little skin in the game of psychology discourse, so I&#39;m not sure I fully followed but I also did get the sense the piece was very constrained in the way magazine features written by academics kind of have to be. In any case, this sentence is transcendent. </p>
