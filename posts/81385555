<p>In late June, the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary force led by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, mutinied against the Russian military. Wagner forces captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and began rapidly advancing towards Moscow before turning back after negotiations.</p><p>Our forecasting group undertook an effort to make live probabilistic predictions about how events could unfold. In this article, we will review our forecasting judgments during the mutiny and also provide our group&#39;s current outlook on key questions facing Russia and Ukraine.</p><h2 id="our-forecasts-during-the-mutiny">Our forecasts during the mutiny</h2><p>Historically, judgemental forecasting requires time to be allocated for question writing and review, followed by the steady input of many forecasters over weeks and months. Live forecasting is therefore somewhat novel, and this was a first shot at this style of forecasting for us at Swift.</p><p>Additionally, at the Swift Centre, we place a lot of emphasis on conditional forecasting. As well as asking forecasters with incredibly strong track records what the chances of a given event is, we want to understand what the <em>consequences</em> of those events might be. This led to our forecasters generating various questions we thought may be consequential, and changing our focus as events unravelled.</p><h3 id="chances-of-success-or-continued-conflict">Chances of success or continued conflict</h3><p>Our initial, top-level question was on whether the Wagner ‘coup&#39; would still be ongoing or have succeeded in 2 weeks after it had started. There was disagreement among our forecasters from the outset of whether we ought to label the event as a coup attempt and, in turn, how we should define a “successful” outcome for Wagner.</p><p>At one point, the group’s aggregate forecast on this was as high as 58%. However, the mutiny did not achieve its stated goals. Specifically, Prigozhin had demanded the handover of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, whom he blamed for military shortcomings and losses among Wagner forces. But both men remained in their positions after the mutiny ended, and the mutineers did not seize control of the Russian government or overthrow Putin. So, it seems clear that it was not successful — whether regarded as a mutiny or a coup attempt.</p><p>There was some internal debate about the success rate of a ‘typical’ coup (which itself is hard to define). One Swift forecaster calculated the average success rate of similar coups to be 28%, though others based their forecasts started from a figure of 50%, as is suggested by <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">academic research</a>. While many of our forecasters did not deviate far from this base rate — as can be wise when it is hard to trust the available information — others placed higher odds on this question resolving positively. This was, in part, because of the possibility of conflict persisting for several weeks, especially given the early indicators of a lack of conciliation, and also because Wagner’s revolt appeared to face very little resistance.</p><p>While some of our forecasters feel our forecasts strayed too high, particularly once it became apparent that the Russian leadership had not been isolated, most felt the group’s forecasts were well-justified given the information available. Even in hindsight, it is hard to say that the sequence of events were predictable.</p><h3 id="forecasting-the-consequences-of-an-uncontained-mutiny">Forecasting the consequences of an uncontained mutiny</h3><p>We forecasted the chances of the mutiny succeeding, or continuing for 2 weeks, up until 18:36 UTC on June 24.

This maneuver is a central objective of Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive.</p><p>Since that weekend, however, our forecasters have reduced their probabilities, assigning a 33% chance that Ukraine severs the land bridge before year&#39;s end. As one explained, &#34;Defence is fundamentally easier than offence, and Ukraine may be thinking that they want to use some of the equipment they have received elsewhere when they have more of a comprehensive force.&#34; Progress remains slow on this front.</p><p>If the land bridge is severed, our aggregate forecast gives an 82% chance to Putin remaining in power through 2023 (down from the 91% given to him in the median scenario). As one forecaster noted, &#34;This would certainly be a significant setback for the Russian war efforts in Ukraine&#34;, and would therefore have to have some effect on Putin&#39;s chances of staying in post.</p><h3 id="chances-of-another-russian-military-rebellion-or-attempted-coup-this-year">Chances of another Russian military rebellion or attempted coup this year?</h3><figure><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/F8miSjwbKO-EvFC-valv3FrxSqx2TjIwR-o2YMkpP58=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzLzIwMjMvMDcvU2NyZWVuc2hvdC0yMDIzLTA3LTMxLWF0LTEwLjQwLjI0LnBuZw==" alt="https://viz.swiftcentre.org/results/tmapWVONnOE?show=cause&amp;conditionals=n3Z1biSsNC8" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/AREoOm5pYW0Mw47uecwtJfY1PiVnZu9HmPQD4d6GuWM=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzYwMC8yMDIzLzA3L1NjcmVlbnNob3QtMjAyMy0wNy0zMS1hdC0xMC40MC4yNC5wbmc= 600w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/5uU8d_gRw5uN_Qe-f8X9XFXlMUeKE2EWcLrPJuOLJqg=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzEwMDAvMjAyMy8wNy9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMDctMzEtYXQtMTAuNDAuMjQucG5n 1000w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/BG7Cn83B6f1tW7CnAKGiHjxkItdDWhzbPUjKg0NOMs0=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzE2MDAvMjAyMy8wNy9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMDctMzEtYXQtMTAuNDAuMjQucG5n 1600w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/F8miSjwbKO-EvFC-valv3FrxSqx2TjIwR-o2YMkpP58=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzLzIwMjMvMDcvU2NyZWVuc2hvdC0yMDIzLTA3LTMxLWF0LTEwLjQwLjI0LnBuZw== 2158w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" loading="lazy"/></figure><p>The group sees a 10% probability of another Russian military rebellion or coup attempt before end of 2023.

The war effort in Ukraine has a great deal of support in Russia.&#34;</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>You can see the overview of our forecasts here (and on this <a href="https://viz.swiftcentre.org/results/tmapWVONnOE?ref=swiftcentre.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">standalone webpage</a>):</p><figure><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/e3e_j54eDm7K1gEB_BBKAfajZ1T6mXVPbtgSyWXdIiI=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzLzIwMjMvMDcvaW1hZ2UtMi5wbmc=" alt="https://viz.swiftcentre.org/results/tmapWVONnOE" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/6uskyxaOiBoQbmWX_ySobx8iA3AbRKF7YbsyEmXUenE=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzYwMC8yMDIzLzA3L2ltYWdlLTIucG5n 600w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/wAfVGqCYZIY42ntrQ4_arDyFkoIf-3oDprNTDSgU3JY=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzEwMDAvMjAyMy8wNy9pbWFnZS0yLnBuZw== 1000w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/RsU-vV9xyeB3w6uBbEBy_OhE1fcPdww5qNzlk5U-3Mk=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzL3NpemUvdzE2MDAvMjAyMy8wNy9pbWFnZS0yLnBuZw== 1600w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/e3e_j54eDm7K1gEB_BBKAfajZ1T6mXVPbtgSyWXdIiI=/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc3dpZnRjZW50cmUub3JnL2NvbnRlbnQvaW1hZ2VzLzIwMjMvMDcvaW1hZ2UtMi5wbmc= 2340w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" loading="lazy"/></figure>
