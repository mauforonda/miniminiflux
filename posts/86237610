<p>There&#39;s a popular saying; &#34;<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/23/drill/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">No One Wants a Drill. What They Want Is the Hole</a>&#34;. It&#39;s a pithy (and broadly) correct statement.  But I don&#39;t think it goes far enough.  Let&#39;s apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Five Whys</a> method to the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one wants a drill. What they want is the hole.</li>
<li>No one wants a hole. What they want is a picture hook.</li>
<li>No one wants a picture hook. What they want is art hanging on the walls.</li>
<li>No one wants art hanging on the walls. What they want is a pleasant living environment.</li>
<li>No one wants a pleasant living environment. What they want is to attract a mate.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Feel free to substitute with your own anecdotes and biases.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some people who will <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/09/a-love-letter-to-electric-power-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">buy ridiculously overpowered tools</a> because they like gadgets. But those gadgets mostly serve as a gateway to our real needs.</p>
<p>Website designers often fail to appreciate that most small businesses don&#39;t <em>want</em> a website. They want customers. The restaurants near me have some truly dreadful websites. Broken URls, crappy pictures, and obnoxious designs abound. I once na√Øvely thought that I could sell them my web design services. But that was a dead end. Those restaurants are full most nights from walk-in traffic. They don&#39;t need a snazzy book-in-advance system. While some people might prefer an online reservation form, the majority are quite happy to call on the phone to book a table. The chances of anyone ordering takeaway from an individual website is basically nill - so they&#39;re happy to go with Just Eat / Deliveroo.</p>
<p>And now we&#39;re seeing the same mistakes made with AI.</p>
<p>I saw a post recently (that I&#39;ll lightly anonymise) which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I think there&#39;s an opportunity to sell AI services to local businesses. Like electricians, retail, restaurants.<br/>
  What services or products I could offer?<br/>
  Perhaps branded ChatGTP? AI content generation? AI trained on their data? AI customer support?
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is 100% the wrong approach. AI is a drill - and people don&#39;t want drills; they want holes.</p>
<p>When I think of all the small businesses I interact with - what could AI bring them? The answer isn&#39;t to fling half-baked technologies at people in the hope it transforms their businesses.  This requires <em>talking to people</em>. Find out what their problems are, what they need fixing, where they struggle.</p>
<p>Does my plumber need an AI trained on 5 years worth of data to know which customers he should prioritise? No! He&#39;s got more work than he can handle and is pretty adept at picking the lucrative jobs.</p>
<p>Does the local charity shop need 24/7 chatbot support which hallucinates the contents of the shelves to potential customers? No! They need some more volunteers to sort through donations.</p>
<p>I think AI can be useful. But it is a <em>tool</em>, not a product.</p>
