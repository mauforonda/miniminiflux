    <h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>My name is Jim Merullo. By day I do application support at a hospital. It&#39;s not a bad job, it pays the bills, but it provides very little in the way of personal satisfaction and it is very much NOT who I am. Who I actually am is a lot of things but I think primarily I&#39;m a maker of things, these days mostly things made out of wood. You can find more of my work at <a href="https://www.jimmerullo.com/" title="Jim&#39;s website." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">my website</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/merulloshop/" title="Jim&#39;s Instagram account." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">on Instagram</a>.</p>

<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>Grizzly Bandsaw, Sawstop Contractor saw. Jet lathe. Stanley planes, Lie-Nielsen saws, Narex chisels. Lately I&#39;ve been building a collection of beautiful tools made by smaller toolmakers such as Mass Woodworks, Crucible and Blue Spruce Toolworks. You ever get excited holding an awl? I have. When it&#39;s hand-forged with a turned paduk handle there&#39;s nothing prettier. I hope to soon have a scorp and a travesher for carving out a chair seat.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also have an <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac-24/" title="An all-in-one computer." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">iMac</a> and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" title="A laptop." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MacBook Pro</a>. They&#39;re made out of plastic and silicon and every few years they get too slow to use so I have to throw them out and replace them.</p>

<h3>And what software?</h3>

<p>As little as possible. For work I use Windows and some Windows-based tools as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_365" title="A hosted office suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Office 365</a>. I am of the opinion that most software is terrible and computers should not be as difficult to use for the average person in the year 2023. Then again, if software wasn&#39;t terrible my job would probably not exist. Since my day job requires that I fight with software all day, when it comes to making and woodworking I don&#39;t want to use software at all.</p>

<p>Plenty of makers use things like CNC, laser cutters, and 3D printers but I have no interest in any of those things. I just want to use my hands to put sharp steel to wood, or cut some styrene with an X-acto knife and glue it to some more styrene. I keep some notes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs" title="A web-based office suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Docs</a> and occasionally if I need a graphic I&#39;ll use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230419034642/https://www.pixelmator.com/mac/" title="An image editor for the Mac." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Pixelmator</a>, a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" title="A bitmap image editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Photoshop</a> clone that is more frustrating than it needs to be. I don&#39;t even use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230930075242/https://www.sketchup.com/" title="3D modeling software." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">SketchUp</a> or anything like that to draw up plans. I use a pencil and paper. All I ever wanted to do since Jr. High School was &#34;work with computers&#34; but I&#39;ve mostly grown to hate computers and aside from the hours and hours I spend on social media and <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/" title="A community website." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MetaFilter</a> I try to avoid using them. I don&#39;t even play games anymore.</p>

<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>I am very fortunate that I have a really nice shop already. I have a dry basement with high ceilings that I&#39;ve built out into a workspace that mostly works for me. I wired good lighting and outlets wherever I need them. If I had the space I might have a couple more bandsaws with different blades on them. If I had unlimited space, time and money I&#39;d have a blacksmith forge, a metal shop, a leatherworking area, a sewing room, a drafting table, and a shop toilet.</p>

<p>Lately, as I transition from more of a general maker into a woodworker, I&#39;ve been thinking about adding more beauty to my workspace. I want to build out an area for my workbench and surround it with beautiful hand tools organized in some sort of hand-built cabinet or tool chest. I&#39;m still figuring out the best thing to do based on how I work. I will not use software to design it.</p>
