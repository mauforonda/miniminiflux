More is different in real-world multilayer networks</h2>
<p>Manlio De Domenico <br/>Nature Physics (2023)</p>
<p>The constituents of many complex systems are characterized by non-trivial connectivity patterns and dynamical processes that are well captured by network models. However, most systems are coupled with each other through interdependencies, characterized by relationships among heterogeneous units, or multiplexity, characterized by the coexistence of different kinds of relationships among homogeneous units. Multilayer networks provide the framework to capture the complexity typical of systems of systems, enabling the analysis of biophysical, social and human-made networks from an integrated perspective. Here I review the most important theoretical developments in the past decade, showing how the layered structure of multilayer networks is responsible for phenomena that cannot be observed from the analysis of subsystems in isolation or from their aggregation, including enhanced diffusion, emergent mesoscale organization and phase transitions. I discuss applications spanning multiple spatial scales, from the cell to the human brain and to ecological and social systems, and offer perspectives and challenges on future research directions.</p>

<p>We provide a brief review of human mobility science and present three key areas where we expect to see substantial advancements. We start from the mind and discuss the need to better understand how spatial cognition shapes mobility patterns. We then move to societies and argue the importance of better understanding new forms of transportation. We conclude by discussing how algorithms shape mobility behavior and provide useful tools for modelers. Finally, we discuss how progress on these research directions may help us address some of the challenges our society faces today.</p>

Cognitive Science of Augmented Intelligence</h2>
<p>Marina Dubova, Mirta Galesic, Robert L. Goldstone</p>
<p>Cognitive Science 46(12)</p>
<p>Cognitive science has been traditionally organized around the individual as the basic unit of cognition. Despite developments in areas such as communication, human–machine interaction, group behavior, and community organization, the individual-centric approach heavily dominates both cognitive research and its application. A promising direction for cognitive science is the study of augmented intelligence, or the way social and technological systems interact with and extend individual cognition. The cognitive science of augmented intelligence holds promise in helping society tackle major real-world challenges that can only be discovered and solved by teams made of individuals and machines with complementary skills who can productively collaborate with each other.</p>

The emergence of dynamic networks from many coupled polar oscillators: a paradigm for artificial life</h2>
<p>Alessandro Scirè &amp; Valerio Annovazzi-Lodi </p>
<p>Theory in Biosciences volume 142, pages 291–299 (2023)</p>
<p>This work concerns a many-body deterministic model that displays life-like properties such as emergence, complexity, self-organization, self-regulation, excitability and spontaneous compartmentalization. The model portraits the dynamics of an ensemble of locally coupled polar phase oscillators, moving in a two-dimensional space, that under certain conditions exhibit emergent superstructures. Those superstructures are self-organized dynamic networks, resulting from a synchronization process of many units, over length scales much greater than the interaction range. Such networks compartmentalize the two-dimensional space with no a priori constraints, due to the formation of porous transport walls, and represent a highly complex and novel non-linear behavior. The analysis is numerically carried out as a function of a control parameter showing distinct regimes: static pattern formation, dynamic excitable networks formation, intermittency and chaos. A statistical analysis is drawn to determine the control parameter ranges for the various behaviors to appear. The model and the results shown in this work are expected to contribute to the field of artificial life.</p>

<h2><br/>
Heterogeneity Extends Criticality</h2>
<p>Carlos Gershenson</p>
<p>While studying rank dynamics, we have found a universal pattern across a broad variety of phenomena: more relevant elements change their rank slower than the majority of elements. Our hypothesis was that this temporal heterogeneity provides a balance between robustness (slow) and adaptability (fast) similar to criticality, but without the need of fine-tuning parameters. With this motivation, we have studied the effect of different types of heterogeneity (structural, temporal, and functional) in complex systems, and shown that each of these “extend” criticality. We have also used heterogeneity as a simple strategy to improve search algorithms. A question remains open: how to find “optimal” heterogeneity?</p>

Evolution of priorities in strategic funding for collaborative health research. A comparison of the European Union Framework Programmes to the program funding by the United States NIH</h2>
<p>David Fajardo-Ortiz, Bart Thijs, Wolfgang Glanzel, Karin R. Sipido</p>
<p>The historical research-funding model, based on the curiosity and academic interests of researchers, is giving way to new strategic funding models that seek to meet societal needs. We investigated the impact of this trend on health research funded by the two leading funding bodies worldwide, i.e. the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and the framework programs of the European Union (EU). To this end, we performed a quantitative analysis of the content of projects supported through programmatic funding by the EU and NIH, in the period 2008-2014 and 2015-2020. We used machine learning for classification of projects as basic biomedical research, or as more implementation directed clinical therapeutic research, diagnostics research, population research, or policy and management research. In addition, we analyzed funding for major disease areas (cancer, cardio-metabolic and infectious disease). We found that EU collaborative health research projects clearly shifted towards more implementation research. In the US, the recently implemented UM1 program has a similar profile with strong clinical therapeutic research, while other NIH programs remain heavily oriented to basic biomedical research. Funding for cancer research is present across all NIH and EU programs, and in biomedical as well as more implementation directed projects, while infectious diseases is an emerging theme. We conclude that demand for solutions for medical needs leads to expanded funding for implementation- and impact-oriented research. Basic biomedical research remains present in programs driven by scientific initiative and strategies based on excellence, but may be at risk of declining funding opportunities.</p>

Opinion Dynamics Explain Price Formation in Prediction Markets</h2>
<p>Valerio Restocchi, Frank McGroarty, Enrico Gerding and Markus Brede<br/>Entropy 2023, 25(8), 1152; DOI: 10.3390/e25081152</p>
<p>Prediction markets are heralded as powerful forecasting tools, but models that describe them often fail to capture the full complexity of the underlying mechanisms that drive price dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a model in which agents belong to a social network, have an opinion about the probability of a particular event to occur, and bet on the prediction market accordingly. Agents update their opinions about the event by interacting with their neighbours in the network, following the Deffuant model of opinion dynamics. Our results suggest that a simple market model that takes into account opinion formation dynamics is capable of replicating the empirical properties of historical prediction market time series, including volatility clustering and fat-tailed distribution of returns. Interestingly, the best results are obtained when there is the right level of variance in the opinions of agents. Moreover, this paper provides a new way to indirectly validate opinion dynamics models against real data by using historical data obtained from PredictIt, which is an exchange platform whose data have never been used before to validate models of opinion diffusion.</p>

Evolution “On Purpose” Teleonomy in Living Systems. Edited by Peter A. Corning, Stuart A. Kauffman, Denis Noble, James A. Shapiro, Richard I. Vane-Wright and Addy Pross</h2>

<p>A unique exploration of teleonomy—also known as “evolved purposiveness”—as a major influence in evolution by a broad range of specialists in biology and the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>The evolved purposiveness of living systems, termed “teleonomy” by chronobiologist Colin Pittendrigh, has been both a major outcome and causal factor in the history of life on Earth. Many theorists have appreciated this over the years, going back to Lamarck and even Darwin in the nineteenth century. In the mid-twentieth century, however, the complex, dynamic process of evolution was simplified into the one-way, bottom-up, single gene-centered paradigm widely known as the modern synthesis. In Evolution “On Purpose,” edited by Peter A. Corning, Stuart A. Kauffman, Denis Noble, James A. Shapiro, Richard I. Vane-Wright, and Addy Pross, some twenty theorists attempt to modify this reductive approach by exploring in depth the different ways in which living systems have themselves shaped the course of evolution.</p>
<p>Evolution “On Purpose” puts forward a more inclusive theoretical synthesis that goes far beyond the underlying principles and assumptions of the modern synthesis to accommodate work since the 1950s in molecular genetics, developmental biology, epigenetic inheritance, genomics, multilevel selection, niche construction, physiology, behavior, biosemiotics, chemical reaction theory, and other fields. In the view of the authors, active biological processes are responsible for the direction and the rate of evolution. Essays in this collection grapple with topics from the two-way “read-write” genome to cognition and decision-making in plants to the niche-construction activities of many organisms to the self-making evolution of humankind. As this collection compellingly shows, and as bacterial geneticist James Shapiro emphasizes, “The capacity of living organisms to alter their own heredity is undeniable.”</p>

<p>From the astonishing evolutionary advances of the Cambrian explosion to our present-day computing revolution, the trend of dramatic growth after periods of stability can be explained through the theory of the “adjacent possible,” says theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman. Tracing the arc of human history through the tools and technologies we’ve invented, he explains the impact human ingenuity has had on the planet — and calls for a shift towards more protection for all life on Earth.</p>

Artificial intelligence is ineffective and potentially harmful for fact checking</h2>
<p>Matthew R. DeVerna, Harry Yaojun Yan, Kai-Cheng Yang, Filippo Menczer</p>
<p>Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here we investigate the impact of fact checks generated by a popular AI model on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the AI performs reasonably well in debunking false headlines, we find that it does not significantly affect participants’ ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. However, the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: it decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs for false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, the AI increases sharing intents for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view AI fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false news. Our findings highlight an important source of potential harm stemming from AI applications and underscore the critical need for policies to prevent or mitigate such unintended consequences.</p>

Multilevel cultural evolution: From new theory to practical applications</h2>

<p>PNAS 120 (16) e2218222120</p>
<p>Evolutionary science has led to many practical applications of genetic evolution but few practical uses of cultural evolution. This is because the entire study of evolution was gene centric for most of the 20th century, relegating the study and application of human cultural change to other disciplines. The formal study of human cultural evolution began in the 1970s and has matured to the point of deriving practical applications. We provide an overview of these developments and examples for the topic areas of complex systems science and engineering, economics and business, mental health and well-being, and global change efforts.</p>

<p>Like chefs at a fast-moving restaurant or engineers in a multidisciplinary project, team members often complete separate, interrelated subsets of larger tasks with limited insight into the work of others. These contexts make it difficult for individuals to assess the value of their own contribution to the collective work. Our work shows that despite this obstacle, individuals can still learn from their neighbors when neighbors’ actions influence collective outcomes. Though the effects are modest, we found that teams with more interactions between members perform better when refining their work while teams with fewer interactions perform better when innovating. We also found that across 34 tasks with diverse qualities, teams that decentralize coordination responsibilities outperform those that do not.</p>

Self-similarity and the maximum entropy principle in the genetic code</h2>
<p>Subhash Kak </p>
<p>Theory in Biosciences volume 142, pages 205–210 (2023)</p>
<p>This paper addresses the relationship between information and structure of the genetic code. The code has two puzzling anomalies: First, when viewed as 64 sub-cubes of a 4×4×4 cube, the codons for serine (S) are not contiguous, and there are amino acid codons with zero redundancy, which goes counter to the objective of error correction. To make sense of this, the paper shows that the genetic code must be viewed not only on stereochemical, co-evolution, and error-correction considerations, but also on two additional factors of significance to natural systems, that of an information-theoretic dimensionality of the code data, and the principle of maximum entropy. One implication of non-integer dimensionality associated with data dimensions is self-similarity to different scales, and it is shown that the genetic code does satisfy this property, and it is further shown that the maximum entropy principle operates through the scrambling of the elements in the sense of maximum algorithmic information complexity, generated by an appropriate exponentiation mapping. It is shown that the new considerations and the use of maximum entropy transformation create new constraints that are likely the reasons for the non-uniform codon groups and codons with no redundancy.</p>
