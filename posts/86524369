<p>I don&#39;t know if this is a bug, or just the way the world works now.</p>
<p>Several of the people who live in my phone use artistic black and white headshots. They look very cool. But my Android phone shows their image with inverted colours - so they look like pure shite.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what my very real human girlfriend looks like when I ring her to go for brunch:<br/>

<p>Come the evening, my phone switches to Dark Modeâ„¢ - so this is what she looks like when I ring her for a late-night booty call:<br/>

The colours have been inverted and it looks rubbish." width="540" height="674" loading="lazy"/></p>
<p>What&#39;s causing this? And is it expected behaviour?</p>
<p>I&#39;m running <code>com.android.contacts</code> version 1.7.34 which <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Contacts/+/refs/heads/master/AndroidManifest.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">appears to be the latest version</a> of the AOSP contacts app. It&#39;s bundled with LineageOS.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not lucky enough to be dating Marylin Monroe, here&#39;s a demo image for you to try:</p>

<h2 id="is-this-expected-behaviour"><a href="#is-this-expected-behaviour">Is this expected behaviour?</a></h2>
<p>Based on some quick tests, it appears that the contacts app will invert some monochrome images when it thinks there&#39;s &#34;too much&#34; bright white in the image.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the contacts list doesn&#39;t invert avatars when in Dark Mode.</p>

<p>And... I don&#39;t know if I want this to happen.  I guess that most people who use Dark Mode want to avoid blinding bright white light searing into their precious eyeballs. But, presumably, they don&#39;t want the photos of their friends inverted into a weird artefact-ridden mess?</p>
<p>So, before I get lost in Google&#39;s Kafka-esque bug reporting process - do <em>you</em> think this is expected or desirable behaviour?</p>
