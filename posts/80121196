a <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/css/mip-research/mip-dataset/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">dataset</a>
of “all instances of US military intervention from 1776 until 2019,
alongside key drivers and consequences of these interventions.” The 392
cases include wars, occupations, major troop deployments, humanitarian
assistance, and other military actions abroad. The dataset categorizes
their objectives, use of force, and outcomes; indicates their location,
foreign states involved, starting/ending year, and human costs; and
provides many additional variables. Its sources include government
publications, media reports, other datasets (such as the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21282" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">International

<p><strong>The latest White House visitors.</strong> In May 2021, the
Biden-Harris administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/disclosures/2021/05/07/biden-harris-administration-reinstates-visitor-log-policy-will-be-first-administration-to-post-records-from-first-full-year-in-office/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">began
releasing</a> its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/disclosures/visitor-logs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">logs of
visitors to the White House</a>. The records now include 500,000+
entries from January 2021 to March 2023, featuring 350,000+ distinct
names and indicating the visit’s timing, visitee, meeting location, and
more. <strong>Caveat</strong>: “However, a Bloomberg News analysis of
the data found duplications, anomalies and missing names,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-26/biden-re-opens-white-house-visitor-logs-but-some-names-are-missing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">write
Eric Fan and Josh Wingrove</a>. “For example, the records […] show just
five visits from Nancy Pelosi when she was House Speaker, despite at
least 20 known instances when she was there.”

<p><strong>NY prison employee misconduct.</strong> For a <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/tag/when-guards-abuse-prisoners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">series

those records</a>, which they’ve converted from two PDFs into tabular
data, along with additional context and caveats. The records contain
~6,000 (non-redacted) notices; they indicate the employee name, title,
facility, union, type of misconduct, case disposition, description, and
penalty, among other details.</p>

<p><strong>Australian mine production.</strong> “No […] study has ever
compiled a national mine production data set which includes basic mining
data such as ore processed, grades, extracted products (e.g., metals,
concentrates, saleable ore) and waste rock,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02275-z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">writes Gavin
M. Mudd</a>, whose <a href="https://rmit.figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_Comprehensive_Dataset_for_Australian_Mine_Production_1799_to_2021/22724081/2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">new
dataset</a> aims to do exactly that for Australia from 1799 to 2021. It
contains mine-by-mine metrics, as well as annual production by state and
element/mineral.</p>

<p><strong>“The global human day.”</strong> By harmonizing “data
collected by national statistics agencies, international organizations,
and researchers from over 140 countries,” <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2219564120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">William
Fajzel et al.</a> have “assemble[d] a complete estimate of what humans
are doing, averaged over time and across the entire population, to
provide [what] we refer to as the global human day.” Their <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8040631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">published data</a> include
global and national estimates for 24 subcategories, such as sleep (~9
hours) and childcare (~17 minutes).</p>
