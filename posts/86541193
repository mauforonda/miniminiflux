We economists have been looking at (a) headline inflation, (b) core inflation—removing volatile food and energy inflation from the headline index—as a better forecaster of future headline inflation than headline inflation is, and recently (c) “supercore” inflation—removing housing inflation from the core—index—on the grounds that recently housing inflation has also become weird, volatile, and self-reversing; thus now supercore is likely to be a better forecast of future headline inflation than either headline or core.</em></p><p><em>The September numbers on inflation were 0.4% monthly headline inflation, down from 0.6%; 0.3% monthly core inflation, steady; and core inflation boosted by a surprisingly large 0.6% housing inflation number—suggesting a fall in “supercore”.</em></p><p><em>If the bet that supercore is the measure we should be looking at, this is good news.

She posts the Alameda internal semi-balance sheet and the “Alt-7” version that was sent to outsiders as they stood on, I believe, early November 2022. The FTT, SRM, and SOL on the semi-balance sheet are SBF- and FTX-created crypto assets with no fundamental value—$8.1 billion, plus another $3.8 billion in crypto assets, plus another $4.6 billion “lent” to SBF and other insiders. All of these had value only to the extent that the crypto Ponzi schemes continued. That is $16.5 on the asset side that could vanish in an instant. Thus the $6.2 billion of notional Alameda NAV could turn into -$10.3 billion in an instant.</em></p><p><em>And on the liabilities side we have the $9.9 billion in “borrowed” FTX customer funds. When you put your money into FTX, and FTX said that it had bought ETH for you, it was quite possible that it had not done so—that it had entered a holdings of ETH in its database, but had actually given the money out to Alameda instead.</em></p><p><em>No matter what Michael Lewis may say, taking your customer’s money and using it to allow Alameda to make very large bets on crypto is not a “great business”—it is, rather, a business that is derivative of the crypto Ponzi scheme, and “great” only as long as the music continues to play:</em></p><p><a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share Brad DeLong&#39;s Grasping Reality</a></p><p><em><strong>Just War Theory Watch</strong></em>: <em>It is not that “intention” rules all.
