The company relies heavily on Nvidia&#39;s graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoftâ€™s partnership to access them.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/jz5NiS8bdOfxgccJaK-jnYMZzjGqXEuN7ePfCr-stLg=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvZTM2Njk0ZjctNDdlYi00NWM3LTg0MDUtYjA4ZmFkMDcxNWM2L2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>Open AI sees in-house chip development as key to tackling two big problems: the global scarcity of high-end AI chips and the massive computing costs of running systems like ChatGPT. CEO Sam Altman has made acquiring more AI chips a top priority given Open AI&#39;s reliance on Nvidia, which controls over 80% of the AI chip market.</p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>Custom AI chips could significantly reduce Open AI&#39;s hardware costs and chip shortage issues, allowing it to scale its AI technologies more easily. However, building custom AI chips is a complex and expensive endeavour that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars with no guarantee of success. Even if Open AI acquires a chip company, it would still take years to develop its own chips.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=2838ebc9-79e9-4700-ad91-5b8025fdd96f&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
