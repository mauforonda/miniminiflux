    <h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m Blackle Mori, founder and resident shark girl at <a href="https://suricrasia.online/" title="Blackle&#39;s anthropomorphic shark-run ISP." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Suricrasia Online</a>. I&#39;m a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" title="The Wikipedia entry for demoscene." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">demoscener</a>, artist, and writer. I do a lot of random stuff on the internet, but most recently I&#39;ve been making <a href="https://cohost.org/rc/tagged/blackleposting" title="Blackle&#39;s CSS posts on cohost." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">CSS Crimes</a> on the website <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170520181209/http://cohost.org/" title="A social network." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">cohost.org</a>, which are little HTML gizmos/games that only use inline CSS.</p>

<p>In my natural habitat you can find me at the <a href="https://revision-party.net/" title="A demoscene event." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Revision Demoparty</a>, competing either in the 4kb <a href="https://suricrasia.online/demoscene/" title="Blackle&#39;s graphic demoscene entries." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">executable graphics</a> categories or in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5997&amp;v=CoOqwPWkL_E&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="A YouTube video showing Blackle&#39;s Shader Showdown entry." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Shader Showdown</a> - a competition where two programmers must write a GPU shader from scratch in 25 minutes.</p>

<p>I also maintain a directory of <a href="https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/" title="Blackle&#39;s directory of cursed computer knowledge." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">cursed computer knowledge</a>, and I write <a href="https://suricrasia.online/unfiction/basilisk/" title="Blackle&#39;s fiction." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">fiction</a> from time-to-time. I can be found on <a href="https://cohost.org/blackle" title="Blackle&#39;s cohost account." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">cohost</a>, the <a href="https://lethargic.talkative.fish/@suricrasia" title="Blackle&#39;s Mastodon account." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">fediverse</a> and my nascent <a href="https://suricrasia.online/blog/" title="Blackle&#39;s weblog." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">blog</a>.</p>

<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>I primarily use a sleeper PC I built inside a Cooler Master Wave Master case, both because I like the aesthetic, and also because I need an opaque case to block out the RGB lighting that nearly every computer part comes with these days. Inside the aforementioned case is an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230921221917/https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800X" title="A CPU." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</a> 8-Core Processor, a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/16-series/" title="A GPU." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti</a>, and 64 gigabytes of RAM. I have a 2TB laptop drive for storage, and a Samsung SSD 980 for the OS and whatever projects I&#39;m currently working on.</p>

<p>I generally put much less though into peripherals. I use a run-of-the-mill microsoft membrane keyboard with a mouse to match, as well as some random 1080p monitor. I&#39;ve covered all of the logos at my workstation with black electrical tape so I&#39;ve forgotten what most of them are. I use stereo speakers with a headphone plug so I can quickly switch between the two.</p>

<p>For audio recording I use a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160413134343/http://www.bluemic.com:80/yeti/" title="A USB microphone." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Blue Yeti</a> (whose raised logo will not accept the black tape) and for video I use a random webcam I got from my local FreeGeek. For digital painting I have a <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/us/bamboo" title="Smaller pen/multi-touch tablets." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Wacom Bamboo CTL-460</a> which I love. I fear the day that thing breaks, because it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s a reliable replacement on the market anymore.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20221113145235/https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadp/thinkpad-p14s/22wsp14p4s1" title="A 14 inch PC laptop." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ThinkPad P14s</a> which is mostly used by my girlfriend when she&#39;s over.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a" title="A 5.8 inch Android smartphone." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Pixel 4a</a> because you can get them for fairly cheap and they work quite well.</p>

<h3>And what software?</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.debian.org/" title="A Linux distribution." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Debian 10</a>, which I am planning to upgrade to the latest version once I find a suitable gap in my schedule. All of my software choices are based on what ran well on my bargain basement laptop from 2008, when I started using Linux full time. I use the <a href="https://awesomewm.org/" title="A window manager for X." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Awesome window manager</a> with a configuration file I&#39;ve been maintaining for about as long. The result is a UI whose buttons look a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP" title="An operating system for NeXT computers." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">NeXTSTEP</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="A cross-platform open-source web browser." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Firefox</a> as my web browser. I recently switched from <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/" title="A WebKit-based browser, where each tab runs in its own thread." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Chrome</a> due to the impending adblock-pocalypse. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to force Firefox to show all my tabs, since I generally have scores upon scores of them open and I don&#39;t like Firefox&#39;s tab scrolling UI. I&#39;ve written a <a href="https://suricrasia.online/blog/firefox-chrome/" title="Blackle&#39;s post about making Firefox act more like Chrome." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">blog post</a> on the topic if the same problem ails you.</p>

<p>For graphics I generally use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" title="An open-source image editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">GNU IMP</a> for 2D editing, and <a href="https://krita.org/" title="An open-source image editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Krita</a> for digital painting (I love their brushes). I use <a href="https://inkscape.org/" title="An open-source vector graphics program." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Inkscape</a> for vector graphics.</p>

<p>For 3D I use <a href="https://www.blender.org/" title="A free, open-source 3D renderer." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Blender</a>, which I also use for video editing - it&#39;s the best video editor I&#39;ve ever used on Linux!</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic" title="A tool for live-coding shaders." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Bonzomatic</a> for shader live coding, but <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/" title="A web-based 3D shader tool." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ShaderToy</a> and <a href="https://www.poshbrolly.net/" title="A shader editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Posh Brolly</a> are always in arm&#39;s reach for when I&#39;m working on something off-stage.</p>

<p>For programming I use a registered version of <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="A coder&#39;s text editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Sublime Text</a> (a going-away present from some former coworkers, thanks guys!) and <a href="https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-terminal" title="A shell terminal for Linux." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MATE Terminal</a> running <a href="https://fishshell.com/" title="A command-line shell." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">fish shell</a>. Not a week goes by that I don&#39;t end up writing a shell one-liner for something.</p>

<p>For programming languages, my top choices for personal projects are <a href="https://www.python.org/" title="An interpreted scripting language." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Python</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="A compiled programming language." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">C</a>. If I want to make a web-based gadget, I generally write everything by hand. I&#39;m an ardent user of <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/" title="The Vanilla JS &#39;framework&#39; site." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Vanilla JS</a>.</p>

<p>I do all my writing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs" title="A web-based office suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Docs</a>, since I can&#39;t seem to find an equivalently-featured and lightweight rich text editor for Linux. The automatic syncing is really nice, too, I can&#39;t deny that.</p>

<p>To listen to music I use <a href="https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet" title="A cross-platform music library manager." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Quod Libet</a>. To make music I use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/" title="An open-source, cross-platform audio editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Audacity</a>, <a href="https://lmms.io/" title="A cross-platform audio creation tool." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">LMMS</a>, <a href="https://vcvrack.com/" title="A virtual audio rack." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">VCV Rack</a>, and <a href="https://milkytracker.org/" title="A audio tracker." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MilkyTracker</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://pinafore.social/" title="A web client for Mastodon." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Pinafore</a> as the front-end for my self-hosted gotosocial instance.</p>

<p>My mobile life is very simple. I just use stock <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/?csw=1" title="A mobile phone platform." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Android</a>. I do use <a href="https://novalauncher.com/" title="A launcher app for Android." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Nova Launcher</a> with a theme that makes everything look like Windows 95. I just love raised borders and pixelated icons! The only other hint I&#39;m a nerd is the <a href="https://termux.com" title="A terminal emulator and Linux environment app." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Termux</a> icon on my home screen.</p>

<p>As a sort of digital fidget toy, I play <a href="https://tetrisconcept.net/threads/texmaster.2/" title="A Tetris-like game." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Texmaster 2009</a> on World/Sudden mode when I&#39;m listening to a podcast or YouTube video. It&#39;s probably the most frequently executed UI program on my system.</p>

<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>I&#39;m quite happy with the hardware I have, though the setting could use some work. My pipe dream is a demoparty that somehow never ends. I could live the eat/sleep/demo/repeat lifestyle, eating free hard-boiled easter eggs behind the E-Werk, sleeping on an inflatable mattress behind the projector screen, throwing back Club Mate after Club Mate...</p>

<p>But more realistically, I would love to have some kind of local computer clubhouse to go to and socialize with other hacker types. Unlike the hackerspace I frequented when I lived in Germany (shout out to <a href="https://www.chaos-darmstadt.de/hackspace/" title="A hackerspace in Darmstadt, Germany." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">CCC Darmstadt</a>!) the hackerspaces in Toronto are largely tool libraries, not software focused as I would like.</p>

<p>As far as dream software goes, I want a search engine that works :(</p>
