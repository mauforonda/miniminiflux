Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) is a book by Martin Kleppmann.
How do I review this incredible reference? Iâ€™ll first say that if you program professionally, you should read this book. It will introduce you to new ideas and help you clarify and reconceptualize ones you may already be familiar with. You are very likely to find relevance to your work in multiple chapters. You can view my abridged notes in Notion here if youâ€™d like.
