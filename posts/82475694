<p>We cover how explosive lenses have a parallel in the “brain as a non-linear optical computer” paradigm developed at QRI. The short explanation is that the “index of refraction” for local field potentials (LFPs) can be modulated with drugs/interventions, and so in principle one can use varying concentrations of things like nitrous oxide, ketamine, and MDMA in order to focus waves of energy to catalyze precisely crafted phase transitions of consciousness.</p>

Another one is how the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">von Neumann computer architecture</a> was a world-transforming significant outcome of the Manhattan Project. In the context of consciousness research, one could envision figuring out the “principles of qualia computing” that allows DMT entities to sample from a wide range of possible “mind designs” as an achievement of comparable significance. Arguably most DMT entities are “psychotic”, but some of them aren’t; the way they copy, mutate, differentiate, and analyze “qualia bundles” hints at a very general set of qualia computing building blocks for alternative qualia-based information processing pipelines. The successful Manhattan Project of Consciousness could in principle lead to a revolution on computing paradigms that generalize to qualia computing systems.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think that the really stunning thing about DMT entities, which I still haven&#39;t properly captured in any content (will I ever?) is their *intelligence*. Here of course I&#39;d talk about a super general qualia-based conception of intelligence. Really, you are sampling from a vast… <a href="https://t.co/K6xACT4OVT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">pic.twitter.com/K6xACT4OVT</a></p>— Linalool Enjoyer, Andrés Gómez Emilsson (@algekalipso) <a href="https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1691172435637452800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">August 14, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>In contrast to the atomic bomb, the kind of “phase transition implosion” developed at the Manhattan Project of Consciousness would be deeply relaxing, rejuvenating, and capable of undoing years of trauma in seconds. Using as research leads “candy flipping done right” (usually with some 2C-B/2C-D/2C-C), 5-MeO-DMT, and LSD + nitrous oxide, one has in fact a lot of hints for how to produce instantly relaxing, deeply healing “waves of enlightened qualia”.</p>



<p>Importantly, the combination of Open Individualism and Valence Realism might catalyze a paradigm shift on how we approach the game theory of human collectives.</p>



<p>If it takes a bunch of geniuses in the desert to figure out how to optimize this effect, so be it. It would be a really worthwhile investment!</p>
