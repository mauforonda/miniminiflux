Alameda traded that many real dollars away to other people in return for FTT and other SBF crypto tokens that had value only as long as people believed in SBF. And nobody does—except for Michael Lewis, who thinks that lending all your money to someone who then uses it to buy s***coins is a “great real business”:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Michael Lewis</strong>: ‘<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/761843f8-c1e2-4980-b086-274214d62380" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">[Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX] isn’t a Ponzi scheme</a>: ‘Like, when you think of a Ponzi scheme, I don’t know, Bernie Madoff, the problem is—there’s no real business there. The dollar coming in is being used to pay the dollar going out. And in this case, they actually had—a great real business. If no one had ever cast aspersions on the business, if there hadn&#39;t been a run on customer deposits, they&#39;d still be sitting there making tons of money…</p></blockquote><p>And yet people are still tiptoeing around ML’s Stockholm Syndrome here:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gideon Lewis-Kraus</strong>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/michael-lewiss-big-contrarian-bet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Michael Lewis’s Big Contrarian Bet</a>: ‘Almost everyone in the world believes that Sam Bankman-Fried is guilty. In “Going Infinite,” the writer takes the kind of risk that his characters often do, and asks us to question that assumption…. Lewis very gently insinuates that Ellison, in over her head, might have made some very bad decisions… reserves an unusual contempt for John Ray… oversee[ing] the bankruptcy, for a variety of purported forensic errors… concludes the book with the suspicion that the mystery of the missing funds might not be a mystery at all—it seems possible, he writes, that the bankruptcy proceedings thus far have in fact accounted for all of it. Bankman-Fried’s insistence that the whole thing was a series of accounting and management errors seems, to most people who have been following this for the last year, ridiculous on its face…. The trial will make him look like a fool or it will make him look like a genius…</p></blockquote><p>Let’s remember what the state of affairs really was: highly illiquid—which a properly run exchange can never be—and presumptively insolvent, unless a miracle were to occur:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Arash Massoudi &amp; </strong><em><strong>al.</strong></em>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/761843f8-c1e2-4980-b086-274214d62380" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Wall Street grabs its popcorn for the FTX trial</a><strong>: ‘</strong>Readers may remember that the FT obtained documents FTX sent to investors last year, which revealed that the exchange—remember this isn’t a bank—held just $900mn in easily sellable assets against $9bn of liabilities the day before it collapsed into bankruptcy…. [That] didn’t strike us as a “great” business. It’s also debatable whether SBF’s trading operations were more legitimate than Madoff’s market-making operation, which was large and separate to his infamous Ponzi scheme…</p></blockquote><p>And what the state of affairs really is: SBF engaging in witness tampering:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Molly White</strong>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/a-preview-of-the-sam-bankman-fried?r=d0v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">A preview of the Sam Bankman-Fried trial</a>: ‘Caroline Ellison… is likely to be the government’s star witness, as she was Bankman-Fried’s top lieutenant. However, she is also likely to face the fiercest cross-examination over her role in the collapse, and she has already been the target of Bankman-Fried’s attempts to shift blame….

He also claimed that their strained personal relationship influenced her actions, in what seems to be an ongoing attempt on his part to portray her as a jilted ex who singlehandedly tanked his empire.
