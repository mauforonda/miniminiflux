<p>I love <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/05/review-clevo-n151cu-lafite-iv-system76-darter-pro-entroware-proteus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">my Linux laptop</a>. But, once in a while, it forgets it has a keyboard. I wake it from a little nap and it&#39;s all like &#34;no, sir! no keyboards here! just use a mouse please!&#34;</p>
<p>Logging in is pretty simple. Pop_OS has an on-screen keyboard which lets me hunt-n-peck <code>P4ssW0rd123!</code> into the box.</p>

But then I&#39;m stuck. I can launch apps - but I can&#39;t type into them.</p>
<p>The on-screen keyboard only seems to work on certain OS elements. It didn&#39;t pop up for the Terminal app.</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> have plugged in a USB keyboard. Or even a Yubikey. But where&#39;s the fun in that? Similarly, I could have rebooted and manually changed Bash&#39;s behaviour. Or done some weird config which turns a middle click into an enter. Or SSH&#39;d in from another machine. But I like a challenge!</p>
<p>So I opened up my browser, clicked to a news story, and then laboriously copied and pasted the letters <code>l</code> <code>s</code> <code>u</code> <code>s</code> <code>b</code> into the terminal. That would show me if my keyboard was stolen by goblins.</p>
<p>But how to run the command? I found a newline on the web page and c&amp;p&#39;d that.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s how I learned that most modern terminals don&#39;t let you paste in an enter. It becomes a newline to stop you automatically running code you shouldn&#39;t. This is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/BracketedPasteBehaviorNotes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">the default behaviour on Bash since 5.1</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/pop/issues/399" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">long running bug</a> about this intermittently glitchy keyboard behaviour. In future, I&#39;ll just reboot.</p>
