It aims to invest over $1 billion in Dojo by 2024, which will be used for training its own AI models (for self-driving) and potentially selling resources like AWS does.</p><h2>What&#39;s going on here?</h2><p>Tesla is investing over $1 billion to develop its own powerful AI supercomputer called Dojo to boost its self-driving capabilities.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/deW6RwONDTD9JSNyS7GLT3V83fsx8XCX69vApKOe6P4=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvMzg2MWNhNWEtZDkwZi00ODBkLWFjZmQtMzExN2E3N2UzMGRjL2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>Dojo is supposed to grow into 100 ExaPods (a custom unit used by Tesla) by next year. The existing facility at Palo Alto can accommodate only 7 ExaPods, which is driving the effort behind this new facility. The new Austin facility will supplement its California data centre to accommodate Dojo&#39;s growth.</p><p>Tesla designed its own specialized AI chip called D1 to run Dojo. Alongside the new facility, it has also doubled the order for these D1 chips from Taiwan.</p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>Musk, investors and market analysts are betting big on the Dojo supercomputer by Tesla. The rationale behind the backing is twofold: </p><ul><li><p>The access to independent compute resources for better self-driving software</p></li><li><p>And the option to sell the access to Dojo in an AWS-like manner meaning revenue outside the Tesla vehicle sales.</p></li></ul><p>More broadly, Tesla developing its own AI supercomputer highlights the growing importance of AI across industries. Companies like Tesla now view robust AI systems as a strategic priority.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=07e44305-03d1-4c7c-b528-77c5b2f92665&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
