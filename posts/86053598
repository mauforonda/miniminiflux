<p><em>Bi-weekly Thursday posts are primarily for paid subscribers, and covers things that are bouncing around in Randy’s head, mostly semi-baked. This week is more of a mishmash of items that are taking up space in my brain.</em></p><h4>Silly Twitter design change actually happens</h4><p>Wow, it actually happened. A month ago I wrote about how practically all <a href="https://counting.substack.com/p/most-metrics-are-conditional" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">metrics were conditional</a> and can’t be understood in a vacuum. It was inspired because rumors of a ridiculous change to Twitter’s design where links to articles won’t have the piece of text that shows the title/url and only show the article picture. Apparently it’s an effort to save screen space, but most people hated the notion since it ruins a lot of the usability. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23903859/x-elon-musk-headlines-links-image-twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Verge reported that the feature actually launched for iOS.</a> I guess we really are going to see how fast they’ll notice issues and walk it back.</p><p>I really do miss the interaction with friends on Data Twitter, but it’s too annoying for me to go back. Just barely getting by with an unearthly mix of Bluesky+Mastodon.</p><h4>Conversations about all-in-one data software</h4><p>I have no idea why, but this week’s post about <a href="https://counting.substack.com/p/everything-tries-to-become-a-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">all-in-one software</a> has had more comments than anything I’ve ever written. It was a lot of fun. It had been a struggle writing that post, partly because of sleep deprivation, partly because it’s really murky and I was writing in an effort to think things through.</p><p>One thing that came out of the conversations was how the capitalistic chase of revenue growth plays a role in why software tends to bloat with features. Companies can’t just leave a product alone for fear of being out-competed by competitors. They have to sell widgets every day while nonprofit projects like open source don’t have the same level of pressure. At best, an open source project competes in a mythical “marketplace of ideas” but earning market share is not really the point.</p><p>Also, a few people mentioned that removing features is extremely rare. I think I’ve only worked on a tiny handful of projects involving removing features. Customers very often complain when any feature is removed because there’s usually at least one person who hangs their entire work process on that feature. It’s far easier to just shove unused features into an “advanced” section than remove it.</p><p>In the end, I think I’m just very uncomfortable with the fact that the path of least resistance for product development is to keep listening to user pain points and adding convenience features until you stumble, willfully or not, into building an all-in-one tool. It takes a very strong design vision to avoid that fate.</p><h4>I need to write a talk =O</h4>
