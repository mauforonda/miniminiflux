    <h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>

<p>Hi, I’m the editor of the “<a href="https://therumpus.net/sections/blogs/funny-women-blogs/" title="The &#39;Funny Women&#39; column on The Rumpus." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Funny Women</a>” column on the online literary magazine <a href="https://therumpus.net/" title="A literary community/magazine." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">The Rumpus</a> and the author of the award-deserving memoir <em><a href="https://www.elissabassist.com/hystericalbookthatiliterallywrote" title="Elissa&#39;s memoir." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Hysterical</a></em> (published by Hachette).</p>

<p>As a founding contributor to The Rumpus, I’ve written cultural and personal criticism since the website launched in 2009. My <a href="https://www.elissabassist.com/writing" title="Elissa&#39;s writing." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">writing</a> has appeared in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Marie Claire</em>, <em>Creative Nonfiction</em>, and more, including the anthology <em>Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture</em>, edited by Roxane Gay.</p>

<p>For 15 years I’ve worked as a freelance writer, editor, instructor, academic, performer, improviser (sorry), and critic. Now I <a href="https://www.elissabassist.com/teachingandworkshopsnotjustforbillmurray" title="Elissa&#39;s workshops and teaching info." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">teach</a> tragicomic writing at The New School, <a href="https://www.92ny.org/class/humor-writing-bassist" title="Elissa&#39;s writing class at the 92nd St Y." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">92nd Street Y</a>, <a href="https://pandemicuniversity.com/tragicomic-memoir/" title="Elissa&#39;s writing class at Pandemic University." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Pandemic University</a>, Lighthouse Writers Workshop, and elsewhere, and I am probably my therapist’s favorite.</p>

<p>Also, I have many, many matches on Hinge.</p>

<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>I’m the proud owner of an outdated <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" title="A very thin laptop." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">MacBook Air</a> that no longer updates software. Due to my aging neck, I keep it on a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/" title="A foldable laptop stand." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Roost stand</a> and use a wireless mouse called Jelly Comb and a wireless external keyboard called <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/" title="An ergonomic keyboard." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue</a>. (I did not name these devices.) (I did name my iPad “iPadollonia” all by myself early in the pandemic.) I use the laptop most often at home or in my office, which is also the New York subway system, where I do my best work because there’s no WiFi.</p>

<p>Back to my aging neck. At home I switch between my laptop and an <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac-24/" title="An all-in-one computer." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">iMac</a> with a million-inch screen that was supposed to fix my posture/body, but it hasn’t.</p>

<p>Recently, for online interviews to promote my book (<em>Hysterical</em> by Elissa Bassist), I bought a UBeesize ring light (still unused) and a recommended <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20230522194202/https://samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/Q2U" title="A USB microphone." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Samson mic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods" title="Wireless in-ear headphones." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">AirPods</a>. And not to brag, but I have a printer-scanner-copied at home that works almost 80% of the time. Also! As every writer should, I have a SAD lamp for winter, when my regular depression meets seasonal depression.</p>

<h3>And what software?</h3>

<p>To write, I toggle between <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" title="A document editor." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190626125457/http://www.literatureandlatte.com:80/scrivener.php?" title="A Mac text editor aimed at writers." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Scrivener</a>. I will warn that Scrivener exacerbated, if not caused, my diagnosed Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.</p>

<p>I wrote an <a href="https://lithub.com/when-your-ocd-therapy-is-also-a-treatment-for-writers-block/" title="Elissa&#39;s essay about writer&#39;s block and OCD on Literary Hub." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">essay about it for Literary Hub</a> and will now quote myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Before you quit,” my psychopharmacologist offered, “get treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder.” For what? I didn’t have that. I had Scrivener. But the psychopharmacologist disagreed. She believed that it wasn’t Scrivener and that I didn’t have writer’s block—I had a mental illness, OCD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The psychopharmacologist’s evidence that I’d provided: It took me 11 years to write and rewrite one book. Which, again, was actually Scrivener’s fault.</p>

<p>For sharing documents and for editing humor pieces and students’ work, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs" title="A web-based office suite." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Docs</a> and am not at peace with it.</p>

<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>

<p>I’ve been learning how to practice gratitude, so I’ll say it’s the setup I have now: two desks in separate locations of my apartment. One is an antique desk for sitting down with my laptop. Another is a hypermodern standing desk that has a motor and charging station that I saw on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok" title="A short video service." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">TikTok</a> (it’s from Costco) for my Mac desktop that I got for free.</p>
