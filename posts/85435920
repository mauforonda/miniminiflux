<h2>Selling the American People | Book Talk</h2><p>On September 7<sup>th</sup>, CITAP hosted a book talk from Lee McGuigan, an assistant professor in the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media and CITAP affiliate. His book ‚Äú<strong><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262545440/selling-the-american-people/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Selling the American People: Advertising, Optimization, and the Origins of Adtech</a></strong>‚Äù addresses the questions, ‚ÄúWhere did adtech come from?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow did data-driven marketing come to mediate the daily encounters of people, products, and public spheres?‚Äù</p><p>In this talk, Lee discussed the dreams and designs to optimize advertising, and an archaeology of affordances as a result of that optimization. Lee established that modern day adtech is not the root of the problem, but rather an outgrowth of a deeper issue.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúLooking back further shows us the adtech as we think about it today is not the root of the problem, but an important outgrowth of the deeper issue of organizing the mediation of private and public life around the twin goals of accelerating the circulation of commodities, and turning any moment of attention or sociality into an investment opportunity.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Lee continued to delve into the fascinating world of advertising technology. We explored how it&#39;s not just about mind control, nor is it merely fantasy. Instead, the discussion shed light on the nuances, failures, and the pivotal role of power dynamics in this realm. A key takeaway was clear: technology, efficiency, and management are the battlegrounds where political struggles occur.</p><p>Looking ahead, the talk reminded us of the urgent need for change. <strong>If we desire media institutions and technologies designed for democracy, justice, and sustainability, then we must make other plans‚Äîand we must do so quickly.</strong></p><p>Watch the entire talk here:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/gGWv6NVkAts?si=6qpZK4eVkBZ4rFfc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Selling the American People</a></p><h2>Real self-care</h2><p>Tressie McMillan Cottom spoke with Pooja Lakshmi, a psychiatrist and author of ‚Äú<strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/696654/real-self-care-by-pooja-lakshmin-md/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Real Self-Care: A Transformative Program for Redefining Wellness (Crystals, Cleanses, and Bubble Baths Not Included)</a></strong>‚Äù on The Ezra Klein Show last week. Tressie &amp; Pooja discussed how Pooja defines <strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/2858887/377355726" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">real self-care and practical tools</a></strong> for implementing boundaries, practicing self-compassion, aligning your values, and exercising power.</p><p>Tressie spoke about self-care in the way that it is widely understood:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúI don&#39;t like the cult of personality of self-care. <strong>I think the sort of goopification of self-care and wellness as a personality-driven, influencer-driven cultural phenomenon really distracts us from the fact that there is a lot of real, urgent, structural pain and experience that intersects with a lot of inequality‚Ä¶</strong> In some cases, I think it can make that inequality worse by saying, ‚ÄòIf these things don&#39;t work for you, it is your fault.‚Äô‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Pooja discusses the thesis of the book, re-defining self-care:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúInstead of thinking of self-care as taking 15 minutes out of your day to meditate or go for a walk, <strong>we need to be thinking about self-care as something that is threaded through every single decision you make in your life: the small decisions and the big decisions.</strong> It‚Äôs actually something to embody, rather than a task to check off your list‚Ä¶ When you deconstruct these choices, the framework that I&#39;m suggesting is that there&#39;s these four pillars of boundaries, compassion, values, and power.</p><p>When you deconstruct that, and you decide to make choices in your life based on your own values, not society&#39;s values and not culture‚Äôs values, that&#39;s deeply subversive. This builds on the work of Audre Lorde, bell hooks, and other black queer thinkers. That&#39;s not an accident at all that those were the folks who put this work into our cultural conversation. Especially for women of color, marginalized groups, black women, or anybody who is, because of their identities, on the outside: this version of self care (I almost want to use the word violent) is self-preservation.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Listen to the entire episode on <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CgHnfi4Wiy3Lh7Ngajd5h?si=33b8c7561ac14338" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spotify</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/boundaries-burnout-and-the-goopification-of-self-care/id1548604447?i=1000628411641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Apple Podcasts</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/2858887/377355726" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">in your browser</a></strong>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p><h2>Publications &amp; Appearances</h2><p>‚ÄúWhat I worry about is that the lessons we learned from other technologies aren‚Äôt going to be integrated into the way AI is developed,‚Äù Alice Marwick spoke with Popular Science about the <strong><a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/ai-2024-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">dangers of AI in the upcoming 2024 presidential election</a></strong>.</p><h2>We are hiring!</h2><p>We are seeking an Executive Director¬†to join us and provide innovative and visionary leadership.
