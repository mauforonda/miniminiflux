            <p>·       Doug Elmendorf offers <a href="https://progress.institute/how-to-translate-research-findings-into-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">five tips for translating research findings into policy</a> (based on his work at the Congressional Budget Office, Treasury, White House Council of Economic Advisors &amp; more): 1) tell them who wins and who loses/distribution effects; 2) think about the specific goals &amp; incentives; 3) communicate in short non-technical ways, and with graphs – people will likely read on their phones; 4) be patient and persistent; 5) encourage students to work in policy to boost the number of people in government who understand social science.</p><p></p>

<p>·       <a href="https://draliceevans.substack.com/p/did-female-driving-increase-saudi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Alice Evans summarizes and gives her interpretation of a new experiment by Daher et al in Saudi Arabia which randomized driver training to women</a>, and found big differences in impacts by marital status  - “Driving enabled more unmarried women to travel independently, get jobs, and exercise financial autonomy. Wives, by contrast, were immobilised.”</p><p></p>

<p>·       In the FT, Tim Harford writes <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61f67834-c228-44bb-b1e9-9a60d6b57d27?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">in praise of randomness</a>, noting that for small grants, giving them randomly is efficient, enhances diversity, and allows measuring impacts. “Since there is a limited amount of cash, and many deserving recipients, and since everyone can see the fairness of drawing lots, why not turn scarce resources into insight?”</p><p></p>

<p>·       On Let’s Talk Development, Yeon Soo Kim and Jeffrey Tanner summarize findings from a new report that uses high-frequency phone surveys to look at <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/protecting-displaced-populations-during-crisis-lessons-high-frequency-phone-surveys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">how forcibly displaced populations compared to people in their host communities during the pandemic</a>. Initial impacts were often a lot worse, and recovery slower.</p><p></p>

But they also reflect the importance of good management. Firms that adopted home working at speed in the pandemic often lacked planning, organization and control processes. Remote teams were led by office-based and office-trained managers who provided little support or structure. Remote work is different from office work, and needs managers, software and hardware that can support it. “ Moreover, it has important benefits on employee retention “I have spoken to many hundreds of managers and firms over the last three years and I repeatedly hear they use home working as a key part of their recruitment and retention strategy. Indeed, another recent experiment on 1600 employees found hybrid reduced employee quit rates by 35 percent.”</p><p></p>

The field has seen a dramatic expansion in the use of EO as a new source of data. Increasing availability of open accessible global-scale imagery and derived products offer a cost-effective complement to ground observations, especially when powered by cloud computing platforms with rapidly growing built-in data catalogs and capabilities to task satellites for acquiring higher resolution imagery. This SI specifically brings together papers that adapt EO models to answer agriculture-related impact questions in developing country contexts.</p><p></p>
