<p>It’s time once again for a roundup of all the childhood-related stories I’ve noticed since the last such post that don’t fit in elsewhere. </p><p>In addition to the standard post, I have a personal note, which is that unfortunately our current nanny’s health does not allow her to continue, and thus we in the process of searching and doing interviews for a new full-time nanny for our three children here in Manhattan. I hope to have someone in place by the end of the week. If you are or know someone we should consider, please do quickly contact me right away with the relevant information. You can DM me on Twitter, PM me on LesssWrong or email me through substack (or email directly if you know it). Thanks in advance. </p><h4>We All Need a Friend</h4><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1678031280183840775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Sorry you are being bullied, here’s some gold?</a> In this case, $40k raised for some reason for a kid who went around asking to make friends.

Most readers summarize my <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046501867X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bryacaplwebp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=046501867X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a></em> as “Parenting doesn’t matter.” But that is only one possible interpretation of the twin and adoption data. The data is also consistent, however, with the theory that most parents are barely trying to get results - at least on many relevant margins. I <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/09/why_im_homescho.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">pondered this in depth</a> before I started homeschooling my kids.

I did ten times as much.</p></blockquote><p>Yep. I interpret the ‘parents don’t matter’ statistics in a similar fashion. If you fail in one or more of many ways one can fail, that does a lot of damage. </p><p>You can then do vastly better than baseline, but that requires you to put in unusually more work or work unusually smart, or both. That doesn’t happen often enough to show in the stats. There is still a lot of room to make a big impact on the margin, but also not in ways systematic enough to show up in the statistics. </p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-023-00173-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Claim that twin studies overestimate environmental influence on educational attainment</a>, that reanalysis reduces 43% influence to 26%. </p><p>I do worry some people will take such things too far. I continue to disbelieve all the claims that nothing matters, or it matters little, or that all that matters is not doing something massively stupid or harmful. I think this is such studies reliably failing to capture the inputs and also outputs that matter, and also comparing remarkably similar environments. It is trivial to say that with a sufficiently different environment you can explain an arbitrarily large share of educational attainment differences. </p><h4>Let Your Children Play</h4><p>Jon Haidt and Peter Gray present a plausible hypothesis: <a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1221094&amp;post_id=135441845&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Play Deprivation Is A Major Cause of the Teen Mental Health Crisis</a>. There is little doubt that real-world play has declined dramatically in scope and quality over the last few decades, as electronics rise as an alternative and we grow massively overprotective of children when they do physical activities. We are especially bad in America about this deprivation of play, so it could also explain why we have an especially bad mental health issue, which the smartphone hypothesis alone cannot explain. </p><p>Note also that to count as play it has to be outside adult control, exactly what we are dead set against so often.</p><blockquote><p>[Research] shows that play is a direct source of children’s happiness. When children are asked to depict or describe activities that make them happy, they depict or describe scenes of play. There is also research showing that when children are allowed a little more play—such as when schools offer a little more recess—the kids become happier. Research also reveals that children consider play to be activity that they themselves initiate and control. If an adult is directing it, it’s not play. The joy of play is the joy of freedom from adult control.</p><p>…</p><p>Research shows that people of all ages who have a strong <em>internal locus of control</em> (internal LOC),<em> </em>that is, a strong sense of being able to solve their own problems and take charge of their own lives, are much less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than those with a weaker internal LOC.</p><p>…</p><p>Moreover, two retrospective studies with adults have shown that those who recall more instances of independent play when they were children are, by various indices, happier and more successful in adulthood than those who recall less such independence.</p></blockquote><p>I find it convincing that this is at least a major part of the puzzle.</p><p>Great news: <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeRangeKids/status/1669515733712216064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Five states</a> now have ‘Reasonable Child Independence’ laws with two more expected this year.

You don’t know my kid at all!’ But I remember thinking, ‘I need to tone myself down.’”</p><p>His prudence paid off. “The cops said, ‘We don’t want to bring Child Protective Services into this,&#39;” indicating that they certainly could, if pushed. So Tom gave them his name and identification, and promised, “I’ll make sure she’s inside our house going forward, officer.”</p><p>And that’s what he and his wife have done. They have changed their parenting, not due to actual danger, but to other people’s perceptions.</p><p>This, in turn, has changed their daughter. After the thwarted walk, “She wanted to try almost immediately again,” says Tom. “But we did not allow her to. Because if she tries again and they find her again, they’re definitely calling Child Protective Services on us.”</p><p>The spunky little girl asked a few more times.

That was wild to me!&#34;</p><p>What&#39;s wild is that a capable child went out to play on his own, made it home by curfew, and nothing bad happened—and it was considered news.</p></blockquote><p>Mostly this is actually good news. The mom in question was confused by why the other kids’ parents were not freaking out, rather than freaking out herself or not letting the kids play. She recognizes that it was fine.</p><p>The fear of strangers or neighbors calling Child Protective Services (CPS) on you <a href="https://twitter.com/OctoAbbi/status/1709203485386817646" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">is not a mirror of the phantom fears about the safety of such actions</a>. It is a highly legitimate fear with high base rates.</p><blockquote><p>Jerusalem: This is... a wild stat. 37 percent of all US children are subjects of CPS reports (28% of white children and 53% of Black children experience CPS involvement before their 18th birthday).</p><p>Abigail: I had a neighbor threaten to call cps beccause I let my kid play in my fully fenced backyard while I watched from inside. She came over, banged on my door, threatened it in front of that kid. People these days call over nothing. Everyone&#39;s scared of it. Moms talk about the fear a lot in my experience.</p></blockquote><p>Some of those CPS reports are cursory, such as those automatically triggered by certain injuries as a precaution. Many others are not. With such high rates of reports, everyone scrambles to avoid being the target, which makes everyone else have to scramble all the more, and so on. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Or, alternatively:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/1678033467987357696" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Chris Amade</a>: Six year olds walking home from school, on their own, is one of those things the rest of the world understands as normal but the US sees as criminal</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0de4c13b-388f-40cb-b7f8-9c782d55d41d_680x460.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/xlro-tYcpp7cPOwOuVXTsOKkmIK_cfu0m2SL9oSbSho=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYwZGU0YzEzYi0zODhmLTQwY2ItYjdmOC05Yzc4MmQ1NWQ0MWRfNjgweDQ2MC5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/WK3oYSHGl0JnNMolghKr8cRi1yxLur1sckTQ5S1eayY=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYwZGU0YzEzYi0zODhmLTQwY2ItYjdmOC05Yzc4MmQ1NWQ0MWRfNjgweDQ2MC5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Cjvi_GnSxcjBPcyp5F080PPboeHjFbMHLKHUH8_1IYk=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMGRlNGMxM2ItMzg4Zi00MGNiLWI3ZjgtOWM3ODJkNTVkNDFkXzY4MHg0NjAuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/ED0bWDxHKXR8dwrN5K48rTSQQplKqyBhshwMdiboUrI=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMGRlNGMxM2ItMzg4Zi00MGNiLWI3ZjgtOWM3ODJkNTVkNDFkXzY4MHg0NjAuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Ti_eYR0bcFUQsJq2rQpzAO8T3oVxpPumdM32sqZnGEg=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMGRlNGMxM2ItMzg4Zi00MGNiLWI3ZjgtOWM3ODJkNTVkNDFkXzY4MHg0NjAuanBlZw==" width="384" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/9SpSYkhauBRc7etzbH8Hkpsmj3KJzQQwV5ORIARMyvY=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYwZGU0YzEzYi0zODhmLTQwY2ItYjdmOC05Yzc4MmQ1NWQ0MWRfNjgweDQ2MC5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/hYRczsmIvTYHh7eL0GnKO1inOy1rQnsdq7pgCWpE4KM=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYwZGU0YzEzYi0zODhmLTQwY2ItYjdmOC05Yzc4MmQ1NWQ0MWRfNjgweDQ2MC5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/t1aBUAU5UzFJyYLE22meXsFZAPszLM5EVprfh-4p9H8=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMGRlNGMxM2ItMzg4Zi00MGNiLWI3ZjgtOWM3ODJkNTVkNDFkXzY4MHg0NjAuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/Ti_eYR0bcFUQsJq2rQpzAO8T3oVxpPumdM32sqZnGEg=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMGRlNGMxM2ItMzg4Zi00MGNiLWI3ZjgtOWM3ODJkNTVkNDFkXzY4MHg0NjAuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AlmostMedia/status/1693064029454086490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Julie Fredrickson sums it up</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Julie Fredrickson: All the risky behaviors are down and everyone is miserable.</p><p>Derek Thompson: The surge in sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts among teenagers has coincided with other behavioral trends: - Reports of smoking are down - Drug use and drinking are down - Sex down, too - Bullying has not increased.</p><p>This seems important, too: CDC reports a notable increase in teens—especially Black teens—missing school &#34;because of safety concerns.&#34;</p></blockquote><p>Well, yes.

A few different things jumped out right away. </p><p>The first was to simply defy the data on strategic behavior, and presume that various forms of cheating and adjustment were going unmeasured. Graduation is largely about negative selection. Did you fail anything? It is easy to send the message to teachers not to fail their students. It is easy to, on the margin, disregard a few extra unexcused absences, or not expel a student. None of that would be measured here as ‘strategic behavior,’ which was categorized as changing graduation requirements or cheating on tests. One does not need to formally<em> </em>alter requirements to radically alter them in practice. As for the tests, yeah, I’m willing to guess some of them got easier. I know for sure there was a lot more teaching to the tests. </p><blockquote><p>Second, we provide descriptive analysis of the trends in state graduation rates by whether states have graduation exams (or experienced changes in graduation exam policies during the panel period). If the rise in graduation rates was entirely due to strategic behavior, we would expect that the states without graduation exams experienced larger increases in graduation rates. But we see the opposite, suggesting that the upward trend in high school graduation is not because schools lowered their academic standards to make graduation easier.</p></blockquote><p>I see the theory here, that tests are the hardest thing to cheat. Except that when the tests are what is gating graduation, it seems plausible schools can find ways to pass those tests without building human capital, or even by sacrificing it. Worst case, state can respond to pressure by issuing a weaker test, or teaching directly to it. One can also see this as, places with gating tests had slack in the form of students who could plausibly graduate otherwise, if only some right answers can be made to appear in the right places.</p><p>It is also very easy to see how NCLB can harm human capital development. If you are focusing on children not failing, and on them passing tests, you are going to invest less in building their actually valuable human capital. You are going to alienate your best students, waste their time, get them out of good habits and teach them the wrong lessons. </p><p>So it’s hard to presume that all of this largely lines up with human capital. It lines up with the capital of saying you graduated, but to what extent is that an absolute good versus a positional good? Similarly, one could presume that NCLB need not be all that causal here, as the economic cost of non-graduation has been rising, which also should lead to higher graduation rates, and also schools being more hesitant to fail a student since it would ruin their lives more.</p><p>In conclusion, I am not convinced here.</p><p>Then there are the schools where no children are left behind, <a href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1704698874697486692" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">because no child is going anywhere at all.</a></p><blockquote><p>Fox Baltimore: The Maryland State Department of Education’s 2022 state test results report Baltimore City’s math scores were the lowest in Maryland.

It sure sounds like they have. You take a few kids, you hire a ‘guide’ to help them and work through learning exercises and enrichment activities while the parents work. Almost as if education were a product, and you could form a market for it, and provide it vastly better (via vastly smaller student-teacher ratios, and being in a nice home rather than in a dystopian hellhole building, and customizing the content, and so on) and cheaper.</p><blockquote><p>Families pay Prenda $2,199 per year, plus additional fees set by the guides, which can range from $2,800 to $8,000, Smith said.</p></blockquote><p>For comparison, the average public school student costs the state roughly $13k/year. State funding for these micro schools seems much lower than that. </p><p>Another data point is that NYC schools <a href="https://twitter.com/Duderichy/status/1705345080209355161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">have been “defunded” to the tune of $38k per student</a>. I realize that space is not free exactly and there is a lot of paperwork, and costs in NYC are higher, but one has to notice this is utterly absurd. </p><p>Even at $13k, one has to wonder about the ‘get a few kids and hire a teacher’ option.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1706757195864367422" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Matt Yglesias says it is wild American schools get so many tax breaks</a>. The obvious response is to point to the full public funding of the public schools and the need to compete with them. You pay your property taxes either way. It does seem wild if and when they get vouchers similar to the amount public schools are funded and then also keep a lot of tax breaks on top of that. </p><p>Whereas <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1706757195864367422" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Labour is saying in the UK they will add a 20% VAT to private school fees</a> via removing their exemption, which they then say they will use to ‘raise educational standards’ since money is not fungible. </p><p>Did you know that letting kids learn what they are curious about helps them learn?</p><blockquote><p>She picks and chooses topics for study based on student interests, not a set of state standards.</p><p>She pointed to one of her students who wants to be a judge. “She wants to learn about the Constitution and government. So why should I say, ‘No, you should learn about ancient Egypt.’”</p></blockquote><p>The two obvious concerns are socialization and situational tail risk. For socialization, I would continue to make the case that most socialization in schools is not the kind you want, and that a few close friends from a micro school or otherwise is vastly superior, and you can find friends in much better and cheaper ways and situations. The real issue is that while most micro school situations with attentive parents are going to go quite well, some parents are not so attentive or caring, and some children could end up in bad spots in ways that are highly blameworthy, as opposed to it happening in a public school where if it happens everyone followed procedure, and admittedly things could go farther south this way.</p><p>Presumably the solution for that is some form of periodic check-in, a test if you will, to ensure that things are going all right. If you are doing very well, warping things to pass the test will be unnecessary, provided it is not too particular (e.g. the student can demonstrate mastery of the Constitution or Egypt, and either counts for history). </p><p><a href="https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-old-school-reformers-case-for?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=98102&amp;post_id=116966416&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Richard Hanania makes ‘The Old School Reformer’s Case for Privatizing Education.’</a> It is the standard set of true observations about what schools are and what it means to force children to spend thousands and thousands of hours in the place the government decides, when they decide it, doing what the government decides, without the right to go to the bathroom without asking first.

And yes, sometimes given who the parents are, their circumstances or their relationship to each other, it will sometimes be impossible or unwise to retroactively ‘fix’ the situation in this way. The best time to intervene and change the situation is before it gets to that point, including on a broader scale. The second best time will in a particular case sometimes be right now, sometimes not.</p><p>Matt then makes the claim that since upper class people marry upper class people but mostly don’t marry lower class people, they are only providing evidence that marriage is good when you marry someone upper class. There is certainly a coherent position that says something like ‘if you have a good enough situation lock it down, otherwise don’t until you get one.’ I  would argue that if anything this throws shade on arguments of the form ‘lower class people should be able to get the message from the actions upper class people take.’ Instead, they often take to heart that they need similarly secure circumstances first, which they rarely will get. So all the more reason one must say the full arguments out loud.  </p><p>This all follows the common pattern where we used to get good thing X via method Y, then we realized (usually correctly) that Y is terrible and stopped doing Y (or we got it via mechanism Z that went away or changed for other reasons), except now we are getting steadily less X and we don’t have a solution. We need more X, so we need alternative methods for getting more X.</p><p>The most obvious X is fertility, which makes this particular situation even trickier.</p><p>The obvious thing to do is some combination of financial support for X or some alternative mechanism Z that causes X, or financial punishment for ~X or ~Z, or supporting helpful norms and other cultural features. In general, people say ‘it is impossible to get more X’ or ‘X is outdated’ or ‘we cannot afford X’ or some such, before trying much. </p><p>More than that, they refuse to say X is good, or that we need more X, because they associate that with support of nasty, no-good method Y or outdated mechanism Z, or otherwise the use of force or shame or pressure. We are against shame, but we also don’t see any way to offer praise or honor for X without considering that shame of ~X.</p><p>Meanwhile, more and more forms of punishment are being considered Ys. </p><p>Every parent knows this dilemma well. </p><p>We need some knob, somewhere, that we can turn to reward the good and discourage the bad.

I can definitely tell when my 2 year old lies to me more reliably than I could a 16 year old.</p></blockquote><p>I am with Eucaliculia here. At first, children can’t lie without giving the game away. Then, slowly, they skill up, until finally they can mostly lie with impunity absent evidence, and they get good at knowing when their story can get double checked. By the end, I was <em>very </em>confident that most of my lies were getting through, and was willing to rather aggressively lie to my parents despite a strict honesty policy for everyone else. </p><p>Whereas with my kids right now, they’re young enough that I’m very confident they almost never successfully fool me. I do expect that to change, but as we say to the God of Death: Not today.</p><p>I do, however, think that parents likely systematically overestimate how often they can detect kids’ lies, and kids overestimate how often they can get away undetected, because parents don’t always tell you that they know you’re lying.</p><p>Rick from Baltimore asks Tyler Cowen, given he does believe in the value of two-parent families, <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/09/from-my-email-on-single-parent-families.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=from-my-email-on-single-parent-families" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">what would his pro-parent plan look like?</a></p><p>Rick’s suggestions mostly involve a variety of proposed cultural shifts towards favoring marriages by moving back towards some older cultural norms, including better tax incentives and perhaps job programs and otherwise helping create more eligible men. Tyler responds that he does not know what would work, but that it could not hurt to indeed get buy-in that this problem really matters and is not a hopeless one, and asks who is on board.</p><p>I am definitely on board. I also notice this kicks the can down the road and dodges the question, and that Tyler would point this out in other contexts. If you want to get buy-in for the importance and tractability of X, you need to help move towards or at least affirm some method Y of getting more X, or it’s all talk and also people won’t know what they are getting behind. </p><p>The answer necessarily involves a combination of financial incentives, lifestyle changes, cultural and norm shifts and attributions of status and honor. Which is dodging the question again, although less so. Concretely, where should we start?</p><p>I would say there are three distinct fronts here - pro-fertility pro-child actions in general, direct pro-marriage incentives and cultural factors.</p><p>We should do the pro-fertility and pro-child actions anyway. Doing this has other benefits that justify doing so, it would make marriage and raising a family more attractive and help move the needle here as well. So much higher subsidies for those who have children, and even more than that get rid of the various albatrosses we tie around parents’ necks, that are doubtless driving potential fathers away. </p><p>We can and should combine that by tying some of those financial incentives to marriage, and ensuring that the tax code, including various virtual taxes (such as the taxes imposed by schools in the form of usually-discounted tuition) essentially never penalizes marriage. </p><p>The obvious way to start on this is to offer a universal option - couples can be given the option to file as individuals if filing jointly would be more expensive. And we should make it illegal to consider spousal income or wealth in need-based educational or other similar assessments. Yes, there are obvious concerns and details that need to be worked out there, and it won’t be cheap, but the alternative is forcing people to choose. </p><p>Cultural shifts are harder to mandate. Financial incentives help, but culture also has a life of its own. That part is less my area. I would start with a bigger fight, where we have developed a norm that when a choice has superior outcomes, we are afraid to point this out and reward those who make that choice or say things that look down upon those who do not make that choice, even in relatively mild form. We are going to have to walk some of that back. </p><p></p><p></p><h4>Don’t Worry, Be Happy</h4><p>Another kind of lie is that unhappy childhoods are good, actually. <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1703108053913002219" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">They’re not.</a></p><blockquote><p>Paul Graham: It&#39;s bullshit that you have to have an unhappy childhood to do great things. You *can* do great things despite having an unhappy childhood, and that misleads people into thinking that it has a positive benefit.</p><p>I want my kids to do great things, and I&#39;m not trying to give them unhappy childhoods so that they can. Exactly the opposite. I know from talking to thousands of YC founders that the best way to make people ambitious is to encourage them.</p><p>It&#39;s certainly a powerful motivation to want to prove people wrong. But if you&#39;re at all independent-minded, you&#39;ll encounter enough resistance to give you plenty of this motivation whether your childhood was unhappy or not.’</p><p>Yheushen.eth: @WalterIsaacson has a slightly different opinion on this.</p><p>Paul Graham: That was what made me write this. It&#39;s not just bullshit, but very dangerous bullshit, because it will allow abusive parents to rationalize and thus continue doing the bad things they&#39;re doing to their kids.</p></blockquote><p>There is indeed a failure mode where you prioritize your child’s present happiness so much that you do not prepare them for the future. What is good for them will not always be what makes them happy. So sometimes you shouldn’t do what makes your kid most happy. Tradeoffs are a thing. That is very different from happiness being an active detriment to ambition or success.</p><h4>You Might Learn Something</h4><p><a href="https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2023/05/27/the-value-of-student-organizations-and-on-campus-education-anecdotal-evidence-from-tim-keller/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Argument that on-campus education is valuable</a> because being a club officer position is valuable, and generally thousands of students get to ‘practice working’ together, giving practical leadership and other experience in a low-stakes environment.

It’s also saying that on-campus education right now is <em>less fake </em>than online-only education, because the things students do among themselves are real while the core educational experience is fake.

Constantly, as children and as adults, we are taught that if something is going to go badly, we should avoid interacting with it. If we are going to mess something up, better to not try, we will only get blamed.

But it&#39;s unclear if this is because of bad policy or bad implementation.</p><p>Hechinger Report: In surveys, teachers at the schools that tried restorative justice said that their school climate improved. But students reported that teachers struggled more to manage classroom behavior. I wondered if disruptive behavior in the classroom might have detracted from learning time, or perhaps even worthwhile and productive restorative justice conversations ate away at precious instructional minutes. Either way, it could potentially explain why some kids’ performance suffered.</p><p>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-019-01013-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Maine study</a>, published online in March 2019 by the Journal of Youth and Adolescence, found no difference in school climate between middle schools that tried restorative justice and those that didn’t.

Most useful policies are not justice. </p><p>Instead, it is a claim that:</p><ol><li><p>This is poorly named.
