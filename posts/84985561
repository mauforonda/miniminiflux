<h2>The catalog is power.</h2><p>Tressie McMillan Cottom spoke with Emily Drabinski, the president of the American Library Association on The Ezra Klein Show last week. Tressie &amp; Emily discussed <strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/the-ezra-klein-show/americas-top-librarian-on-the-rise-of-book-bans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">book bans, critical librarianship, the public goods that libraries provide, and more</a></strong>. Discussing her first job working in a college library, Emily said </p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúI was working on shelving the last sets of books and we had one copy of Christine Jorgensen&#39;s memoir, an autobiography about a trans woman, published in the 1960s. That book was downstairs in the basement in the section for mental illness &amp; psychiatric diseases. We had a second copy of that book that had a historicizing introduction, and it was on the third floor where we shelved social problems. I was struck by the distance between those books. They tell you [by way of shelving] that gender is a problem in your brain. Then, the other one tells you that gender is a social construction that is malleable‚Ä¶ <strong>So the context where the book sits is consequential for the meaning we can make from it.</strong>‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Tressie responded to this example of meaning making and said,</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúI was thinking many of us encounter ‚Äúthe catalog‚Äù as just the card catalog. But you&#39;re saying it&#39;s more than just this accessible, lowly, practical way to find a book or resource. <strong>What you just described to me, the catalog is power.</strong> There‚Äôs a lot of power where the books are placed, and how.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Emily and Tressie also discussed that banning books is not just a ban on books but also a ban on ideas, as the books that have been challenged are disproportionately written by or about members of the LGBTQIA+ community and/or by or about BIPOC people. Emily states ‚Äú<strong>If we define the problem as simply one banned book, the solution is put that book back on the shelf.</strong>‚Äù Instead, the situation is much more expansive and ideological in nature.</p><p>Listen to the entire episode on <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4AROfw24LjyTcawiNWtIAF?si=60532fb44eac4383" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spotify</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/americas-top-librarian-on-the-rise-of-book-bans/id1548604447?i=1000627578151" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Apple Podcasts</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://player.fm/series/the-ezra-klein-show/americas-top-librarian-on-the-rise-of-book-bans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">in your browser</a></strong>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p>üö®The President of the Mellon Foundation, Elizabeth Alexander, will be hosting a virtual discussion with Tressie and Emily on <strong><a href="https://readingpowerfreedom.splashthat.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">September 26<sup>th</sup> at 4pm on Reading, Power and Freedom</a>.</strong></p><h2>Disinformation participation</h2><p><em>(research summary by Katherine Furl)</em></p><p>Technologies provide their users with a wide variety of different affordances, or all the things it is possible to accomplish through any given technology.
