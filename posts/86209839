I&#39;d like to tell you about two YouTubers I like.

To set the scene, there&#39;s an obnoxious sliver of YouTubers who review luxury experiences: they document their $20K first class flights, stays in $5K/night hotel suites, and visits to splendid restaurants, plucked from the echelons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Michelin guide</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_50_Best_Restaurants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">World&#39;s 50 Best</a>. 

These reviews are almost always shot with top-notch equipment and edited with sleek, sexy transitions; the end result feels overly-polished and formulaic, almost like an ad. And the YouTubers (or more accurately, influencers) narrating these videos seem like they&#39;ll happily sell you urinal cakes if the company pays for their flight and swanky lodging. <em>Mmm</em>, they recite, ogling a perfectly shaped mound of black pearls, <em>this world-class Ossetra caviar pairs amazingly with an unparalleled view off this cantilevered brazilwood deck.</em> 

They don&#39;t (yet) have the journalistic integrity of reporters, or the practiced authenticity of celebrities, or the expertise of true industry insiders. They&#39;re young, pretty, and tenacious, and they know how to optimize the content for 15-20 minutes of your attention (or however long The Algorithm demands these days.)

And I don&#39;t have qualms with their lack of expertise. Most of us don&#39;t really know much about the opulent things that are sold to us. These YouTubers learn enough to teach me something, and I feel like I get to linger around the part of the plane I&#39;m normally rushed past on my way to Economy.

But I do mind that these YouTubers will do whatever gets them views. You can see this in many smaller channels: they&#39;ll film travel vlogs, unboxing videos, apartment walkthroughs, exercise routines, makeup routines, 30-day experiments, whatever - until they figure out what the audience wants. Then, they&#39;ll just focus on that. It feels like they don&#39;t have anything authentic to say; they just want to be famous. 

In this shallow, superficial landscape, enter YouTuber #1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alexandertheguest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Alexander the Guest</a>. Alexander is a well-built, immaculately-groomed, 40-something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Magyar</a> who runs a one-Michelin starred restaurant in Hungary. (One star is already exceptional.) On his channel, Mr. the Guest only visits 3-star restaurants, which are <em>really</em> rare: there are only 13 in all of the US. 

In contrast to the malleable, sweet Gen Zs, Alexander has the energy of a corporate tyrant who was recently told, to his dismay, that he has to be in the company&#39;s promotional videos. He&#39;s overdressed, stiff, and over-enunciates each word. It feels like any moment, his smile will turn into a scowl and he&#39;ll <strong>snap</strong> and ream me out for for not hitting my sales goals. My first impression of Alexander was that he really didn&#39;t want to be there.

People who first visit top-notch restaurants are often pleasantly surprised by how warm the experience is, and other YouTuber-gastronomes try to channel this attitude... but not Alexander. Alexander seems like he breathes fine dining and high culture. I&#39;d be afraid of using the wrong fork in his company.

And he visits <em>niiiice</em> places. Presumably the proceeds from his one-star restaurant pay for him to visit three-star ones? I first stumbled on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2RKdhmpf8A" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">his visit to the renowned Geranium</a>. I was uncomfortable watching it, but also mesmerized, because the camerawork, editing, but especially his descriptions of the dishes are very high-quality. I didn&#39;t love sharing my fantasy-dinner with Alexander, but I did love learning from his experience.

A few weeks later, YouTube suggested me another video, and I pursed my lips... and clicked it. I listened to Alexander&#39;s thoughts on the dishes and fine wines. He&#39;s not a poser or influencer; he seems like a man who knows what he&#39;s talking about, and you should too. 

Some time later, a third. This time, I was excited to hear what Alexander thinks. His reviews are not saccharine or shallow; he doesn&#39;t hesitate to say &#34;this dish has impressive craftsmanship, but the flavors just don&#39;t deliver,&#34; or &#34;the food was top notch, but the service was awkward and disorganized.&#34; His taste and judgement feel consistent.

Alexander is now one of my favorite food YouTubers. He&#39;s still stiff and uptight, although he seems to be getting more comfortable (or perhaps I&#39;m getting more comfortable watching him?) I&#39;d still be really intimidated to dine with him. But I have a good sense for his attitude towards restaurants, and he shares thorough, consistent, knowledgeable reviews of some of the most incredible restaurants in the world. The amazing production quality isn&#39;t there to cover up his lack of experience, it&#39;s there to make his thoughts more vivid.

If I want to learn what it&#39;s like at a new restaurant, I first check if Alexander has a video on it.


YouTuber #2 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EmmaCruises" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Emma Cruises</a>. Cruising is a popular way to vacation, and the ships are kind of like floating neighborhoods. People pick them based on size, luxury, food, and style. You can sail the rivers with a bunch of stodgy elders with Viking, or get a tattoo before you party the night away with Virgin.

My parents cruise often (and I&#39;ve joined them a few times,) so in the past I&#39;ve looked up ships walkthroughs on YouTube. All the ones I saw were mediocre: some middle-aged vacationer walking around the ship with his camera, seemingly on a welcome break from his family, ad-libbing what he sees: 

<p><em>&#34;This is the buffet... that opens up to... a large... pool area... and over here... here... here is another grill. And over there is the Seabreaker Lounge... I&#39;m gonna just walk over there... oh, sorry... yeah this place gets crowded... the Seabreaker is a trendy spot on the ship to get drinks, and, oh hi Jorge, and it, um... </em></p>
You get the idea: a 15-30 minute lecture with a rambling self-taught seafaring anthropologist.

In contrast, Emma is a young Brit with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX1f_R3Jmqk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">gentle, calming voice</a>. She puts out  well-edited, well-structured videos, though, until recently, her production value was closer to home movies than the polished work of swanky YouTubers. She often overlays a voice-over in post production rather than talking as she films. Her scripts nicely balance her personal experiences with objective descriptions of the ship, and she often references her other cruising experiences for comparison. 

And Emma <em>loves</em> cruising. She beams with joy talking about cruising as a teenager and seems genuinely happy to be on the ships. She has the energy of a nice high-schooler (I think she&#39;s, like, 28): a little shy, but excited to show you around a place she knows really well.

By the time YouTube suggested Emma to me, she already had  a very respectable 50-100K subscribers, but she still seemed like a niche YouTuber. But her content has always been well thought-out and consistent in style. Run-of-the mill vacationers will film the cruise they went on and then move on with their lives. Luxury-chasing YouTubers will praise whatever suite the luxury cruise company gives them. But Emma sails with every cruise line and ship out there, often in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKHOhGD9Tp8&amp;t=357s&amp;ab_channel=EmmaCruises" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">the cheapest cabin</a>. Her comment sections are polite, sweet, and have a real sense of community, since cruisers tend to be, on average, in their 50s and 60s, and because it feels like you&#39;re really going on a journey with Emma, not just listening to an ad narrated by her.

Emma now has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJIg3828uhk&amp;ab_channel=EmmaCruises" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">plush version of her cat</a>, Hudson (of course,) that she brings with her. She sells the plush and donates the proceeds to charity.

Emma is really nice to listen to. In her company, I&#39;ve walked through many cruise ships I&#39;ll never sail on.


Emma and Alexander are exceptional because they are consistent and they have <em>style</em>. They&#39;re both sharing what feels like their genuine take on the world, and although I&#39;ll never know their motives, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re both benefitting from it, it seems to come from a place of real love and curiosity for the thing they&#39;re doing.

And their style might not be for everyone - Alexander might be too Upper-Management-y for some, and Emma might be too British Grandmother-ly for others. But both creators have committed to their authentically unique voice, and by showing up and being themselves day after day (as much as I can tell), they&#39;ve built out nice, interesting channels.

I love that. At a time when many YouTubers seem to be willing to do whatever and be whomever for your <s>ad dollars</s> likes and subscribes, Emma and Alexander seem to unapologetically be saying: &#34;here&#39;s my thing. It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s not for you.&#34; They&#39;re putting in the hours anyway, building something unique, and in my opinion, something worth watching.

I wish more artists were like that. More of us should follow our heart&#39;s calling in art, whether it sells or not.
