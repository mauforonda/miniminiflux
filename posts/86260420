<p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about maintenance at work lately, for various reasons. So this post from Meredith Farkas last year really resonated. I&#39;m already thinking about how to build in future maintenance needs to project approval processes, and who to hassle about awards for maintenance.</p>

<p>One of my favourite things about <em>Evidence based library and information practice</em> is the way they name their articles. No burying the lede here. This one is actually a review of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01930826.2022.2026119" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">another article</a>, (also open access) but you can save yourself 35 pages of reading. In a huge surprise to nobody it turns out things like ‚Äúmy colleagues treat me with respect‚Äù and ‚Äúmy manager listens to me‚Äù are correlated with high staff morale.</p>

<blockquote><p>‚Ä¶Do you like keeping up with archivists, librarians, and curators?</p>

<p>‚Ä¶Are you weirded out by billionaire tech bros with no business sense?</p>

<p>‚Ä¶Does it seem like there‚Äôs always a new algorithm messing with your social media?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an alternative to all of this, and it‚Äôs Mastodon. ...Eira Tansey (Memory Rising, LLC) is hosting a free online event for learning how to use <a href="https://glammr.us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mastodon</a> to connect with all your archivist pals!</p></blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re in Australia, the local equivalent of glammr.us is <a href="https://ausglam.space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">ausglam.space</a> run by me üôÇ</p>
