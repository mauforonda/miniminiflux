I built &amp; deployed my first useful webapp over the past week. A friend in with a background in public health teed up a perfectly-sized intro project, a tool to check extended COVID test expiration dates without trawling through PDFs on the FDA website. Iâ€™ve been a software engineer for years and have wanted to learn how to build frontend UIs for a while, after realizing the relative chaos and churn in that field during the early 2010s seems to have been resolved and the toolchain seems pretty mature.
