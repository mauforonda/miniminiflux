This is the keynote I prepared for PyData Amsterdam 2023. The TL;DR is that we must understand the historical context of our engineering decisions if we are to be successful in this brave new LLM world.
The text here isnâ€™t exactly what I said, it was my notes ahead of time. My slide template is by Barbara Asboth, who also did the templates for Normconf.
Good morning PyData Amsterdam! An enormous thank you to the organizers, the sponsors, to PyData, and to you, the attendees, for coming!
