<p>We saw this Monarch butterfly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">caterpillar</a>
at the pretty unusual <a href="https://www.brooklyngreenway.org/naval-cemetery-landscape/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Naval Cemetery Landscape</a>.
The landscape is just native pollinators and native plants
growing wild, with a wood platform above the field so you can walk around
and see the bugs and plants. It’s also built on a cemetery that was
moved to another site, but they <a href="https://www.brooklyngreenway.org/naval-cemetery-landscape/history-and-design/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">didn’t move all the bodies</a>, so there are still
some unaccounted for in the park.</p>

<p>I know that every generation looks at the younger generation
and fears that their cultural memory is getting shorter, but
isn’t it? Adam Neely, who I’ve mentioned before when he
<a href="https://macwright.com/2021/03/03/recently" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">talked about the ‘Sea Shanty’</a>
trend on TikTok, came out with this great breakdown of
Laufey, jazz, and the dangers of rewriting history.</p>

which is not quite jazz - if something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal_Hands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mammal Hands</a>
are halfway between jazz and electronica, GoGo Penguin is 75% of the way to electronica. But I love it anyway:</p>

and I’ve cried during about 40% of the Season 2 episodes. I
appreciate the show even more because I have absolutely no interest
in running a restaurant or watching people cook or eat – I actually
have what is probably a common aversion to the TV trope of people
constantly talking while eating. The Bear basically dodges all
of that and tells a great story. The soundtrack is great, too.</p>

<p>My experience with companies in the last few years has
made me a believer in the power of <em>vibes</em>, which is why I
like <a href="https://longform.asmartbear.com/fail/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">this article about rephrasing failure</a>.
I know that words don’t have magic power, and that
trying to use language to change reality doesn’t work directly.
But building stuff is such a struggle filled with setbacks
that the people who survived have a naturally persistent
mentality, or they put a lot of time into managing their
positivity and attitude.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://axiomvaluation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023.09.16b.-Building-Wealth.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">contrarian take about real estate</a> is a good counter-point to the
common assumptions about home-ownership. A good snippet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, despite the positive performance of both wealth components, the lowest income class lost out on a relative basis because it was over invested in real estate.
Building wealth through purchasing a consumer durable like a home is not
equivalent to making an investment that produces a stream of sustainable income.
Although owner-occupied home values have increased over time, to access the
wealth potentially created, one needs to sell the home and of course find another
place to live.</p>

<p>I’ve been making some more progress on side-projects - I <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/09/17/bikeshare-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">wrote about the bikeshare project</a> and made time to <a href="https://macwright.com/drawings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">illustrate that and another post this month</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on my custom Tidbyt display as well. I think for both
this and the bikeshare project, I’m going in with the attitude that they don’t
make much sense. Neither is going to be a big open source project
or the seed idea for a startup. They’re both great on-ramps to learning
new skills: my understanding of Rust, Parquet, and DuckDB is getting gradually
better.</p>

<p>I even used the Tidbyt project as an angle to start learning <a href="https://www.blender.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Blender</a>
again, and this time I’m gotten a lot more momentum. I’ve been keeping
notes on the <a href="https://www.are.na/tom-macwright/blender-resources-vc4d6w9agae" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">resources I use as I go</a> - which seem to include a lot of YouTube videos written by teenagers
who are talking about Blender as an alternative to Roblox. My renders
look bad so far – I don’t know anything about lighting or the rendering
pipelines. Someday I want to learn how to make those <a href="https://stamen.com/shadows-on-maps-are-getting-a-lot-more-exciting-and-heres-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">amazing shadowy maps</a>
and also how to use <a href="https://twitter.com/OskSta" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">flat renderers to make beautiful watercolor-esque games</a>.</p>
