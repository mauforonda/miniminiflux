Game designer James Ernest plays and makes games of many kinds, including tabletop games and casino/gambling games. In <a href="https://crabfragmentlabs.com/lecture-hall/black-box-mechanics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">&#34;Black Box Mechanics And the Ethics of Gambling in Games&#34;, published on January 12th, 2021</a>, he writes, &#39;Are gambling games ethical at all? That&#39;s the root question here and of course the answer is complicated. In theory? Yes. In practice? Not always.....I often see folks in computer games decrying the use of “gambling mechanics” in games, but I think we need to be a little more specific.&#39; I learned from his comparisons of laws, practices, and intuitions surrounding swimming pools and casinos, and &#34;Context Part 2&#34; on what&#39;s particularly pernicious about &#34;black box mechanics [being] dicey outside of the casino,&#34; as well as his definition of an ethical payout.
