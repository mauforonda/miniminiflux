<p>At long last, the audio version of the Convivial Society returns. </p><p>It’s been a long time, which I do regret. Going back to 2020, it had been my practice to include an audio version of the essay with the newsletter. The production value left a lot to be desired, unless simplicity is your measure, but I know many of you appreciated the ability to listen to the essays. The practice became a somewhat inconsistent in mid-2022, and then fell off altogether this year. More than a few of you have inquired about the matter over the past few months. Some of you graciously assumed there must have been some kind of technical problem. The truth, however, was simply that this was a ball I could drop without many more things falling apart, so I did. But I was sorry to do so and have always intended to bring the feature back.</p><p>So, finally, here it is, and I aim to keep it up. </p><p>I’m sending this one out via email to all of you on the mailing list in order to get us all on the same page, but moving forward I will simply post the the audio to the site, which will also publish the episode to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-convivial-society/id1522126693" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4cbTb5qgTRCsDLW57na2iL?si=ff35bc883e924fb7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spotify</a>. </p><p>So if you’d like to keep up with the audio essays, you can subscribe to the feed at either service to be notified when new audio posts. Otherwise just keep an eye on the newsletter’s <a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">website</a> for the audio versions that will accompany the text essays. The main newsletter will, of course, still come straight to your inbox. </p><p>One last thing. I intend, over the coming weeks, to post audio versions of the past dozen or so essays for which no audio version was ever recorded. If that’s of interest to you, stay tuned. </p><p>Thanks for reading and now, once again, for listening.</p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Michael </p><p><em>The newsletter is public and free to all, but sustained by readers who value the writing </em>and<em> have the means to support it.</em></p><p><a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/subscribe?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Subscribe now</a></p>
