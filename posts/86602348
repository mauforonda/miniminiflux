The protections aim to give customers more confidence in using AI tools like Duet AI and Vertex AI.</p><h2>What&#39;s going on here?</h2><p>Google Cloud is offering new legal protections for customers using its generative AI services.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/vozDWZjG5qHdsLGGs_ToZy8NJcKyF6CimNAqqrkDOl4=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvNTczZGI1ZWItODQ0Ny00NDVjLTg3ZGMtNmE1MTE5MGUxZmY3L2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>The new protections are two-fold. First, Google Cloud is explicitly clarifying that it is not violating any third-party IP rights in training its model. In simple terms, this protects customers from claims based on Google&#39;s use of training data.</p><p>Second, Google Cloud is adding a new indemnity covering the generated output of certain AI services like Duet AI and Vertex AI. This protects customers from claims related to output generated by Google&#39;s AI tools, assuming responsible use. </p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>Microsoft and Adobe have made these announcements already. These new legal protections address a major concern for companies adopting generative AI - the risk of intellectual property claims related to generated content. With Google Cloud also joining in, Amazon is left now.</p><p>Remember these are for Google Workspace and Vertex AI use (i.e. Google Cloud customers). Bard and Search AI are not covered in this protection.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=89578ab8-467c-4b0e-b93b-8c8f8c3586f9&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
