<li>Poland’s economy, including its energy sector, is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, including coal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In recent years Poland has significantly developed its renewable energy potential, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and rolled out energy efficiency measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yet challenges remain, attributable to the government’s failure to devise a coherent national energy strategy and its insistence on picking fights with the EU over “sovereignty”; together, these weaken Poland’s influence over European energy policy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Poland has the potential to carry out an ambitious energy transition, considering its renewable energy potential, plans for nuclear power, and public support for change.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whatever the results of the 2023 parliamentary election, the government should aim to forge a cross-party consensus in favour of the energy transition and give it a strategic weight comparable to Poland’s accession to the EU and NATO.</li>
</ul>
<p>The energy transition is one of the key challenges facing the world. It is the process that will transform the carbon-intensive global economy into a diversified, sustainable economy. For individual countries, their governments, and societies, the transition will involve eliminating the use of coal and other fossil fuels. To achieve this, national decision-makers will need to increase the...</p>
