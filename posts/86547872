Three managers and directors share their observations of a painful job search.</p></li><li><p><strong>Linear update.</strong> It’s been a year since we <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linear" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">heard from Linear</a>, but the company just raised another round of funding – despite already being profitable. I asked CTO Tuomas Artman for an update: they still don’t have product managers, are still full-remote, and have started using Elastic and Terraform since.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why does Google Chrome direct some .io domains to Google Search?</strong> Enter the domains of some scaleups, like sentry.io, incident.io, branch.io, or mod.io, into Chrome’s address bar and press enter; it might take you to Google Search instead of the domain. This is a bug: and the fix will take about two months to roll out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discussing employer-confidential matters in a semi-public Slack chat? Beware.</strong> Two employees did just this, and were fired the next day. It’s a reminder that non-employer Slacks are considered public forums.</p></li></ol><h2>1. Industry pulse</h2>
