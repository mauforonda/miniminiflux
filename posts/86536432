<p>Since 1969, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Ninety men have had the honor so far. Two women have also won — but only together with men. The first woman to win the prize solo was announced this Monday: The Royal Academy chose <strong>economic historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Goldin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Claudia Goldin</a></strong> “for having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes.”</p>



<p>So what’s up with “women’s labour market outcomes”? Is the <strong>gender gap</strong> still a thing? </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s still a thing — even though <strong>since 2022, more women than men in the U.S. hold a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher,</strong> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/#progress-in-closing-the-gender-pay-gap-has-slowed-despite-gains-in-women-s-education" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">according to Pew Research</a>. </p>



<p>The good news is that the gap is closing<strong>.</strong> More women than ten or twenty years ago lead states and companies, and sit in parliaments and on advisory boards.</p>



<p>But while women are catching up in society overall, <strong>the gap is <em>widening</em> within age cohorts</strong> in the U.S.:</p>

<p>Why? A big chunk of the explanation is that in 2022, 66% of these women aged 35–44 had a child at home. &#34;Historically, much of the gender gap in earnings could be explained by differences in education and occupational choices,&#34; the Nobel Prize committee <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">wrote</a>. &#34;However, Goldin has shown that the bulk of this earnings difference is now between men and women in the same occupation, and that it<strong> largely arises with the birth of the first child</strong>.&#34;</p>



<p>Indeed:</p>

<p>That&#39;s not just because women in the U.S. earn less money after a child is born — it&#39;s also because <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/#employed-mothers-earn-about-the-same-as-similarly-educated-women-without-children-at-home-both-groups-earn-less-than-fathers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">men earn more</a> (and often have to) after that happens. Childless men between 35 and 44 years old make only 84% of the money that same-aged fathers make.</p>



<p>Here&#39;s Goldin explaining her theory about that phenomenon in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanwai/2022/03/25/how-can-women-overcome-the-challenges-of-greedy-work-and-couple-equity-for-career-and-family/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">interview from last year</a> (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote><p>The employee who is willing to work at all hours — in the evenings, on weekends, on vacations, and is on-call at the office — gets the bigger rewards. When these rewards are <em>disproportionate</em> to the time put in, meaning that doubling the time, more than doubles the earnings, we get <strong>“greedy work.”</strong> [...]</p><p>If an individual has children or some other family responsibilities, someone must be on-call at home, even if that person has a job. The “on-call at home” person will take a position that has more flexibility and is less demanding and, in consequence, pays less even on a per hour basis.</p><p>Women are generally the ones who are on-call at home. That’s <strong>couple inequity</strong>. [...]</p><p>Why can’t dual-career families share the joys and duties of parenting equally? They could, but if they did, they would be leaving money on the table, often quite a lot. <strong>The 50-50 couple might be happier, but it would be poorer.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Happiness, the gender pay gap and couple equity — it&#39;s all very much related. <strong>“We’re never going to have gender equality until we also have couple equity,”</strong> Goldin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/economy/claudia-goldin-nobel-prize-economics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">said</a> when interviewed about the Nobel Prize.  </p>
