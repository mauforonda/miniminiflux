In response to rising inflation, monetary policy makers quickly ratcheted up interest rates surprising financial markets multiple times. The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, implemented multiple consecutive 75 basis point hikes, a pace of increase not seen since the 1980s. Prior to this rapid adjustment, real interest rates in the United States (U.S.) reached a nadir not seen in almost 80 years. EMDEs saw equally rapid increases in policy rates. Against this backdrop, the path forward for policy makers has become more uncertain and so have the expectations of policy moves.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099225009112325487/idu14ebfbcdf1e343147b91969714a2b11c8a77f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">recent paper</a>, we estimate measures of fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty as well as their impact on output and prices for 54 economies —  32 advanced economies and 22 EMDEs.</p>

An increase in fiscal policy uncertainty from government spending is associated with a statistically significant drop in real GDP, private consumption, and fixed investment as well as a marginal increase in prices. Monetary policy uncertainty follows a similar dynamic, being associated with a decrease in real GDP and an increase in prices.</p>

<p>There are also differences in how advanced economies and EMDEs respond to policy uncertainty shocks (figure 2). Monetary policy uncertainty is more detrimental in EMDEs and is associated with lower output and higher inflation whereas fiscal policy uncertainties are more harmful in advanced economies and is associated with a greater fall in output.</p>

<p>The impact of monetary policy uncertainty in EMDEs may be greater because firms may raise prices due to lack of confidence that the central bank will maintain its inflation target. These economies may also be more sensitive to changes in real interest rates because of the role external debt plays in smoothing consumption. In advanced economies, government spending is generally more efficient and its impact on growth for each additional dollar of spending is greater (that is, a larger fiscal multiplier), suggesting a higher cost to firms and households from rising fiscal policy uncertainty (See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439321200116X" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Ilzetzki, Mendoza, and Vegh (2013)</a>; <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2020/09/03/Well-Spent-How-Strong-Infrastructure-Governance-Can-End-Waste-in-Public-Investment-48603" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Schwartz et al.
