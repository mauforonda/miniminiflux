<p>Microsoft Research New England is hiring a predoctoral research assistant to work with Nancy Baym, danah boyd, Tarleton Gillespie, and Mary L. Gray on issues related to the dynamics of technology and society.  </p>



<p>An appropriate candidate will be a self-starter who is excited and knowledgeable about studying the social and cultural implications of technologies. Strong skills in writing, organization and academic research are essential, as are time-management and multi-tasking. Minimal qualifications are a BA or equivalent degree in a humanities or social science discipline and some qualitative research training. A master’s degree is preferred but we also consider candidates with a bachelor’s degree and substantial, relevant research experience.  </p>



<p>For this particular call, we are especially interested in pre-docs whose work and interests touch on organizations, management, and/or analyses of institutions, structures, and transformations of work from a sociotechnical perspective. </p>



<p>Job responsibilities will include:  </p>



<ul>
<li>Sourcing and curating relevant literature and research materials  </li>



<li>Developing literature reviews and/or creating and managing annotated bibliographies  </li>



<li>Coding ethnographic and interview data  </li>



<li>Copyediting manuscripts  </li>



<li>Working with academic journals on themed sections  </li>



<li>Assisting with research project data management and event organization  </li>
</ul>



<p>The predoc will also have opportunities to collaborate on ongoing projects. While publishing is not expected, the predoc may have the opportunity to co-author papers while at MSR. This contingent full-time position will be under Microsoft’s Hybrid Work policies, where employees may now work from home up to 50 percent of the time. It is a contract position currently funded until June 2024, with a possible option for an extension. Microsoft works with contracting services that typically offer flexible scheduling and healthcare benefit options. The start date will ideally be in December 2023, although flexibility may be possible for the right candidate.  </p>



<p>This position is ideal for emerging scholars planning to apply to PhD programs in Communication, Media Studies, Organizational and Management Sciences, Sociology, Anthropology, Information Studies, History, Philosophy, STS and Critical Data Studies, or related fields, who want to develop their research skills and area expertise first. Current New England-based MA/PhD students are welcome to apply provided they can commit to 40 hours of work per week.  </p>
