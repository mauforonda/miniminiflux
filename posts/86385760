You can expect op-eds, essays, rants, and more to be featured in these publications. Keep an eye out for the first CITAP Sounds Off&#34; this Thursday!</p><p>Now, onto this week‚Äôs round up‚Ä¶</p><h2>First Amendment Day</h2><p>October 4<sup>th</sup> was UNC‚Äôs 14<sup>th</sup> annual ‚Äú<strong><a href="https://medialaw.unc.edu/first-amendment-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">First Amendment Day</a></strong>‚Äù, a daylong series of events that is designed to both celebrate the First Amendment and explore its role in the lives of Carolina students. First Amendment Day was organized by the <strong><a href="https://medialaw.unc.edu/first-amendment-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Center for Media Law &amp; Policy</a></strong>.</p><p>The day started with a Banned Books Reading on the steps of Manning Hall. Francesca Tripodi, CITAP principal investigator and SILS Assistant Professor, opened the event asking those in attendance that as they hear excerpts from challenged books to reflect on a poignant question:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhat is it that makes these books so objectionable? As we look at the history of challenged books, the target moves over time‚Ä¶ <strong>Fighting for power is always going to be something that make those who have it feel uneasy.</strong>‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Some of the banned books read included:</p><ul><li><p><em>A Wrinkle in Time</em></p></li><li><p><em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em></p></li><li><p><em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</em></p></li><li><p><em>The Hate U Give</em></p></li><li><p><em>I Am Jazz</em></p></li></ul><p>Later that afternoon, CITAP participated in a panel discussion, ‚Äú<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/W810nAp_zG4?si=dwcYBBeRUmtOcczn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Elections, Expressions, and Platforms: The 2023 U.S. Presidential Race</a></strong>.‚Äù The panelists included Daniel Kreiss and Shannon McGregor, as well as Deen Freelon, Professor of Communication at University of Pennsylvania and Founding PI &amp; Senior Researcher at CITAP, all moderated by Alice Marwick.</p><p>Alice asked the panelists about generative AI, asking ‚ÄúDo you think this is going to have any impact on the 2024 election? Because there are think pieces and hot takes galore right now, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that anything is actually happening.‚Äù</p><p>Shannon discussed how the pattern of moral panic around new media and technology has occurred before, with varying outcomes, depending on usage. <strong>While there&#39;s no widespread evidence that AI-generated political content will significantly affect elections, the concern itself erodes trust. </strong>The most significant impact of generative AI on the 2024 election appears to be its influence on people&#39;s perceptions.</p><p>Daniel added that rather than focusing on sensational aspects, understanding the role of generative AI in politics should consider mundane tasks. It can help political campaigns create content efficiently, enhance research, provide ideas, and assist with images. <strong>Concerns about disinformation or dark arts of campaigning may be overblown, similar to the exaggerated fears around deep fakes. </strong>AI&#39;s potential impact might be seen on the edges in areas like accurate search results or spam. Outdated information generated by AI tools could affect political campaigns. In the realm of spam, <strong>AI could enable political spammers to produce content at scale, potentially suppressing legitimate voices.</strong> Nevertheless, over time, systems and institutions may evolve to address these issues.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/W810nAp_zG4?si=kEaBDMh14oZa03cF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Watch the panel discussion</a></p><h2>CFP: The future of conspiracy scholarship: New epistemologies and imaginaries</h2><p>Alice Marwick and affiliate Zelly Martin are editors for a special issue of Journal of Information Technology &amp; Politics (JITP) on¬†<strong>new epistemologies and imaginaries in conspiracy theory scholarship:</strong></p><p>‚ÄúThis special issue aims to push the boundaries of conspiracy studies beyond extant work, which primarily focuses on the alt-right, health, and Western understandings of conspiracy (Halafoff et al., 2022; Mahl et al., 2022, 2022; Marwick et al., 2022). We answer calls to expand understandings of conspiracy beyond Western epistemology (Mahl et al., 2022) to contribute to a fuller conceptualization of ‚Äúconspiracy-believing‚Äù (Parmigiani, 2021). We examine the troubling content and implications of conspiracies in a manifold manner while acknowledging their potentially harmful impact.</p><p>We invite those interested in conspiracy as it applies to epistemology, knowledge production, technological artifacts, gender/race/class, and reception, inter alia. Importantly,¬†<strong>papers must engage with technology and political communication scholarship¬†</strong>in some form.‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://think.taylorandfrancis.com/special_issues/journal-information-technology-politics-conspiracy/?utm_source=TFO&amp;utm_medium=cms&amp;utm_campaign=JPG15743" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">CFP Info</a></p><h2>Publications &amp; Appearances</h2><p>Tressie McMillan Cottom appeared on the October 6th episode of ‚Äú<strong><a href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/lovett-or-leave-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Lovett or Leave It</a></strong>‚Äù live from Asheville, along with North Carolina‚Äôs Governor, Roy Cooper, and drag performer, LaLa Ri.
