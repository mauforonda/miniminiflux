<p>Hello All,</p><p>For much of my career, full conventional war was something that received very little discussion as a possible phenomena. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the military dominance that the USA showed in Desert Storm (the First Iraq War), meant that any large scale conventional war would have to not involve the USA (if the USA was involved, it would be dramatically different). Really, for 30 years it meant that when it came to war, the focus was overwhelmingly on things such as Insurgency/Counter-Insurgency, Air-power and special forces, Information/Hybrid War, etc. The study and discussion of large-scale conventional war seemed to decline dramatically in universities, for instance, and was relegated to military colleges and a small number of think-tanks. However, if much of the world was not interested in conventional war, conventional war (to steal a line that has been reputedly said Leon Trotsky) was always interested in us.<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b96e392-d26a-4500-8668-00f3e34e8dbe_711x965.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/SU66jGix9kNErfHKI0sHWs_fR2vQ9EqE0cheNOuIXZg=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY2Yjk2ZTM5Mi1kMjZhLTQ1MDAtODY2OC0wMGYzZTM0ZThkYmVfNzExeDk2NS5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/_gPXKP46msFHiZpUFHCjjkZNV4WSDov5LE-xNL7xdlc=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY2Yjk2ZTM5Mi1kMjZhLTQ1MDAtODY2OC0wMGYzZTM0ZThkYmVfNzExeDk2NS5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/I7EglmAmQTt_JPAKschad8N9buzjYXuxi5-ESR-ZDzM=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNmI5NmUzOTItZDI2YS00NTAwLTg2NjgtMDBmM2UzNGU4ZGJlXzcxMXg5NjUuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/q1wylO2YxUiroCnPgGe3RJSpA-6Rcd96lODkMfC5EzQ=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNmI5NmUzOTItZDI2YS00NTAwLTg2NjgtMDBmM2UzNGU4ZGJlXzcxMXg5NjUuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/7XINAAGQZOMQvcaPSXOnhajGruSoyuP6v05ZqoFZktQ=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNmI5NmUzOTItZDI2YS00NTAwLTg2NjgtMDBmM2UzNGU4ZGJlXzcxMXg5NjUuanBlZw==" width="711" height="965" alt="Leon Trotsky - Uicipeid" title="Leon Trotsky - Uicipeid" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/iMuIkxBfEZ6v-9aPDmR2xQVuE-LsQxPn_imTZg8B0k8=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY2Yjk2ZTM5Mi1kMjZhLTQ1MDAtODY2OC0wMGYzZTM0ZThkYmVfNzExeDk2NS5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/TpPOMkG6QFiUnIz7cKTPj4hchaq9cN4emYxohkXe6M0=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY2Yjk2ZTM5Mi1kMjZhLTQ1MDAtODY2OC0wMGYzZTM0ZThkYmVfNzExeDk2NS5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/lOZZHzv6Yv7XKR8qSoyTTDrGOJC6z4TJfSv8MGmI8h0=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNmI5NmUzOTItZDI2YS00NTAwLTg2NjgtMDBmM2UzNGU4ZGJlXzcxMXg5NjUuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/7XINAAGQZOMQvcaPSXOnhajGruSoyuP6v05ZqoFZktQ=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNmI5NmUzOTItZDI2YS00NTAwLTg2NjgtMDBmM2UzNGU4ZGJlXzcxMXg5NjUuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Leon Trotsky: Bolshevik Minister of War in the Russian Civil War, and mass murderer.</figcaption></figure><p>In the last few years, conventional war has returned with a vengeance. The Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine figures most prominently, but also the Azerbaijani campaigns to retake Nagorno-Karabakh, and now what looks it will be an Israeli conventional campaign to occupy Gaza (more on that below). Moreover, its not just the actual conventional wars that threaten our world, there is a real possibility that the largest economic/technological powers in the world could go to war in the near future. China and India have competing claims on their border that regularly erupt into small-scale confrontation and, of course, the US and China are now openly confronting each other in the seas of the Indo-Pacific region.</p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f2b13da-a1c2-4393-abef-d3667938ad92_445x267.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/FTAkZ3XGXUAIaKCqC-t9GoWkmJUbFmpjqPR3A_JESjE=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3ZjJiMTNkYS1hMWMyLTQzOTMtYWJlZi1kMzY2NzkzOGFkOTJfNDQ1eDI2Ny5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/8Qq0aNLNq24kWINWwMs6yjjppAlc-DgHrqETmPjFaJY=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3ZjJiMTNkYS1hMWMyLTQzOTMtYWJlZi1kMzY2NzkzOGFkOTJfNDQ1eDI2Ny5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/b0GCWVvDUcHuPg-ICsw9Wll2vLIL5V6D1m5eY-LQrLw=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGN2YyYjEzZGEtYTFjMi00MzkzLWFiZWYtZDM2Njc5MzhhZDkyXzQ0NXgyNjcuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/nXq5Od4kQeKHDbpEycVwcNBkXZ6EXBl-VqQDICCTGIw=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGN2YyYjEzZGEtYTFjMi00MzkzLWFiZWYtZDM2Njc5MzhhZDkyXzQ0NXgyNjcuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/7Jxhmm9fjCha2YnFczw-y_k730tvjHLrKMctkjXHZPo=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGN2YyYjEzZGEtYTFjMi00MzkzLWFiZWYtZDM2Njc5MzhhZDkyXzQ0NXgyNjcuanBlZw==" width="445" height="267" alt="Indian anger and Chinese indifference quash hopes of border resolution |  India | The Guardian" title="Indian anger and Chinese indifference quash hopes of border resolution |  India | The Guardian" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/uB46MwjshSyozBZM0QMqwzOMPGWoPjFvAXbhNbSNE8M=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3ZjJiMTNkYS1hMWMyLTQzOTMtYWJlZi1kMzY2NzkzOGFkOTJfNDQ1eDI2Ny5qcGVn 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/RJ6IwESrGJnAxsWcA7XNsS6OBLx-PL6LI38DzcjPLBo=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY3ZjJiMTNkYS1hMWMyLTQzOTMtYWJlZi1kMzY2NzkzOGFkOTJfNDQ1eDI2Ny5qcGVn 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/pGXBnYgp430rTXwgLjLWQx41G8MLT7-Rcq0xffBmjXY=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGN2YyYjEzZGEtYTFjMi00MzkzLWFiZWYtZDM2Njc5MzhhZDkyXzQ0NXgyNjcuanBlZw== 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/7Jxhmm9fjCha2YnFczw-y_k730tvjHLrKMctkjXHZPo=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGN2YyYjEzZGEtYTFjMi00MzkzLWFiZWYtZDM2Njc5MzhhZDkyXzQ0NXgyNjcuanBlZw== 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Indian and Chinese forces clash on their common border, April 2023: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/india-accuses-china-of-aggressions-amid-border-stalemate</figcaption></figure><p>The return of conventional war is perhaps the single most important strategic development of this era, and its one that we must try to understand, prepare for (and ultimately try and prevent). One of the key elements in that, is to make people understand that the choice for conventional war is almost always catastrophic for the state that initiates the war. One of the most distressing things about the discussion of a Russian invasion of Ukraine before Feb 24, 2022 was the widespread idea that such a war could be conventionally won quickly (one analyst even said confidently that the war would conventionally be over in a day or so). </p><p>Whatever happens, going forward, we need to study conventional war more closely. There is a good chance that it will define the era we are in and the one we are going into. With the US sure to experience a relative economic decline as the global south continues to grow, and democracy increasingly under threat, the chance of large-scale conventional war is almost certainly on the up. One of the reasons I was so pleased to join the Center for Strategic and International Studies as a Senior Associate (non-residential) this week is that it provides an ideal situation in which to contribute to what I see as fundamentally important work on war and power.<a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a> We have to hope that wars continuing interest in us is matched by a better understanding by us in what matters in war, and as such we can make conventional war less likely and not more.</p><p></p><p>Phillips’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

I did not give any because I’m no expert in the region and nothing I can say would be of any value at all. And I certainly wont write much about it in the coming weeks. However, I was asked, quite interestingly, to think about what this might matter for Ukraine and the Russo-Ukraine War. Short answer now, is that is might matter hardly at all, or it could end up hardening different strategic groupings. </p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa22c054b-3e10-4edb-8c01-05d447321e7e_4234x2823.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/nEZNvMuseCvJi79Wu86jlTf9rz25gUdWK9g00p_D2_4=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZhMjJjMDU0Yi0zZTEwLTRlZGItOGMwMS0wNWQ0NDczMjFlN2VfNDIzNHgyODIzLmpwZWc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/WqZlHfcDoTTmcHdxD8OKEFnRxzeoeMUmcoFNAaHoU1Y=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZhMjJjMDU0Yi0zZTEwLTRlZGItOGMwMS0wNWQ0NDczMjFlN2VfNDIzNHgyODIzLmpwZWc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/98bm-pHTFFuxaHCpzpz8gt05F_VOs0AbYa05yx_ZMsA=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGYTIyYzA1NGItM2UxMC00ZWRiLThjMDEtMDVkNDQ3MzIxZTdlXzQyMzR4MjgyMy5qcGVn 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/i8vXC_xu2W5JbVuyJyCkqLsHe-YdHEA1otl0g8BFpc4=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGYTIyYzA1NGItM2UxMC00ZWRiLThjMDEtMDVkNDQ3MzIxZTdlXzQyMzR4MjgyMy5qcGVn 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/RvPBfJZ9fTnPt3Jm_OsD4Vww7IxIrAQciK5zvY8RM2c=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGYTIyYzA1NGItM2UxMC00ZWRiLThjMDEtMDVkNDQ3MzIxZTdlXzQyMzR4MjgyMy5qcGVn" alt="In photos: Hamas unleashes attack from Gaza on Israel - The Washington Post" title="In photos: Hamas unleashes attack from Gaza on Israel - The Washington Post" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/cXtWrvRzJJbIvhbo6OH57x4auEA9yHBvxO99SP1gMZA=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZhMjJjMDU0Yi0zZTEwLTRlZGItOGMwMS0wNWQ0NDczMjFlN2VfNDIzNHgyODIzLmpwZWc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/2ZYY4RESyLlor1-5MJaGHZW7s-WD3gOLyoudKVoF2ww=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkZhMjJjMDU0Yi0zZTEwLTRlZGItOGMwMS0wNWQ0NDczMjFlN2VfNDIzNHgyODIzLmpwZWc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/B2CSIvZpwYLFMP6SfH_d1Td9yc60dLjOJgN3loyy1Nc=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGYTIyYzA1NGItM2UxMC00ZWRiLThjMDEtMDVkNDQ3MzIxZTdlXzQyMzR4MjgyMy5qcGVn 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/RvPBfJZ9fTnPt3Jm_OsD4Vww7IxIrAQciK5zvY8RM2c=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGYTIyYzA1NGItM2UxMC00ZWRiLThjMDEtMDVkNDQ3MzIxZTdlXzQyMzR4MjgyMy5qcGVn 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Hamas Rockets Fired towards Israel Yesterday</figcaption></figure><p>In the first instance. there might be very little impact on the Russo-Ukraine War.

People who know far more about this conflict than I are saying that Iran almost certainly provided a great deal of the logistical and planning support needed by Hamas to launch such a well-planned and supplied operation. It would make sense—this would be almost impossible for Hamas to have resourced on its own. And this could matter, if in essence countries like Israel, which have sat on the fence in the Russo-Ukraine War, now start acting more and more as allies to one side or the other.</p><p>Certainly its interesting to see the instinctive reactions of Russia and Ukraine. President Zelensky released a strong statement in support of Israel, while the Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement that supported the Palestinian position on territorial return. </p><p>Here is Zelensky’s statement:</p><p><em>“Today, the entire world saw horrifying videos from Israel. Terrorists humiliate women and men, detain even the elderly, and show no mercy,” Zelensky’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1710723464414282183" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">post</a> read. “In the face of such a terrorist strike, everyone who values life must stand in solidarity.”</em></p><p><em>“We in Ukraine have a special feeling about what has happened. Thousands of rockets in the Israeli sky… People killed just on the streets… Civilian cars shot through… Detainees being humiliated…,” Zelensky continued. “Our position is crystal clear: anyone who causes terror and death anywhere on the planet must be held accountable. Today’s terrorist attack on Israel was well-planned, and the entire world knows which sponsors of terrorism could have endorsed and enabled its organization.”</em><a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></p><p>Here is the Russian Foreign Ministry statement:</p><p><em>Russia is gravely concerned over a sharp escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In this we regard we would like to reaffirm our principled and consistent stance that this conflict, which has continued for 75 years, cannot be resolved by force and can be settled exclusively by political and diplomatic means, by engaging in a full-fledged negotiation process based on the well-known international legal framework stipulating the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with a capital in East Jerusalem that co-exists with Israel in peace and security.</em><a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></p><p>Now actually until this time, many states such as Israel have tried not to join one-side or the other in the Russo-Ukraine War. They have deliberately provided only limited support to Ukraine and tried to keep good relations with Russia. This may no longer be possible—especially if Israel broadens its response to include attacks far from Gaza. There are already official Israeli statements that they are attacking targets in Lebanon. However the most dramatic broadening would be Israeli attacks on targets in Iran. Iran is arguably Russia’s most important strategic ally in the war, having provided Russia with absolutely vital military aid, most famously the Shahed UAVs, which Iran is helping Russia to mass-produce. </p><figure><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c0784f0-8cda-4c2f-8878-015dbd68fa88_770x770.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/yvH6AOwPq5UI99yBakXtG8wNIW0_Rdn_PeC0WQkr0Eo=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY1YzA3ODRmMC04Y2RhLTRjMmYtODg3OC0wMTVkYmQ2OGZhODhfNzcweDc3MC5wbmc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/-IyKpsZ1OLBBA69yXBjRToAEfYrFBtaStnnkndlNCnA=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX3dlYnAscV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY1YzA3ODRmMC04Y2RhLTRjMmYtODg3OC0wMTVkYmQ2OGZhODhfNzcweDc3MC5wbmc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/v7_Cn3FSp9LmP2xTyoQjPd-SmG9X4fTQXsyZiEJCgJY=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNWMwNzg0ZjAtOGNkYS00YzJmLTg4NzgtMDE1ZGJkNjhmYTg4Xzc3MHg3NzAucG5n 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/ipabsmx1nd9r6Q_O0abnW3BUgCJPHmsgjF_l4NQyL4E=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl93ZWJwLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNWMwNzg0ZjAtOGNkYS00YzJmLTg4NzgtMDE1ZGJkNjhmYTg4Xzc3MHg3NzAucG5n 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/_4BAdanI6LmvE85nPEXduxDQK-qbYcjXPv0E79DOB4g=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNWMwNzg0ZjAtOGNkYS00YzJmLTg4NzgtMDE1ZGJkNjhmYTg4Xzc3MHg3NzAucG5n" alt="Analysis: What&#39;s behind Iran&#39;s alleged drone deal with Russia? |  Russia-Ukraine war News | Al Jazeera" title="Analysis: What&#39;s behind Iran&#39;s alleged drone deal with Russia? |  Russia-Ukraine war News | Al Jazeera" srcset="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/09Qd-8YNehFv_cmfNxrtu8Cu8oLo1SyjQykeopXXxpg=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd180MjQsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY1YzA3ODRmMC04Y2RhLTRjMmYtODg3OC0wMTVkYmQ2OGZhODhfNzcweDc3MC5wbmc= 424w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/6O0QiP8Ty1xS2zWXcu_8R9_eIX3XQOA952-FypF6b9A=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd184NDgsY19saW1pdCxmX2F1dG8scV9hdXRvOmdvb2QsZmxfcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmU6c3RlZXAvaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZzdWJzdGFjay1wb3N0LW1lZGlhLnMzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20lMkZwdWJsaWMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY1YzA3ODRmMC04Y2RhLTRjMmYtODg3OC0wMTVkYmQ2OGZhODhfNzcweDc3MC5wbmc= 848w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/zi5teXgOMmkBF5-dQpDq0L6x-Hv1kxZQWIUq20EGQk4=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xMjcyLGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNWMwNzg0ZjAtOGNkYS00YzJmLTg4NzgtMDE1ZGJkNjhmYTg4Xzc3MHg3NzAucG5n 1272w, https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/_4BAdanI6LmvE85nPEXduxDQK-qbYcjXPv0E79DOB4g=/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdWJzdGFja2Nkbi5jb20vaW1hZ2UvZmV0Y2gvd18xNDU2LGNfbGltaXQsZl9hdXRvLHFfYXV0bzpnb29kLGZsX3Byb2dyZXNzaXZlOnN0ZWVwL2h0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3Vic3RhY2stcG9zdC1tZWRpYS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tJTJGcHVibGljJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGNWMwNzg0ZjAtOGNkYS00YzJmLTg4NzgtMDE1ZGJkNjhmYTg4Xzc3MHg3NzAucG5n 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Iranian Made Shahed UAV: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/31/analysis-irans-new-weapons-and-its-involvement-in-ukraine</figcaption></figure><p>So this is potentially the most important impact of what is going on in the Russo-Ukraine War. Its broadening out, and the formation or greater bloc activity to support each other. If so. conventional war might even expand and the Russo-Ukraine War be part of a larger global war.</p><p><em>Sidenote: </em>I’m no expert, but all I will say as someone who studies war is that the Hamas operation looks exceedingly well resourced and planned. This had to be many months in the preparation (if not years). It was also kept incredibly quiet—and caused arguably the greatest intelligence failure of the modern era (I cant think of a greater failure than Israeli intelligence has just experienced). Hamas should be the number 1 priority for Israeli intelligence, and they missed completely this major operation. I would also say that people talking about Israel reoccupying Gaza, as if that was militarily straightforward, are trivializing what could be a horrific task. Gaza has 2 million people, is a densely packed urban environment, and one assumes Hamas has serious weapons stockpiles. Any ground invasion is fraught with enormous peril for both the attacking forces and the civilian population. I cant think of a worse area for large scale fighting from both a military and humanitarian perspective.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/p/weekend-update-49-you-might-not-be?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share</a></p><p><strong>Duelling narratives over the counteroffensive</strong></p><p>With all the attention moving to the Middle East, the focus moved away from Ukraine in the last 48 hours. That’s not surprising. The counteroffensive seems to be in a lull, as Ukrainians and Russians are trying to restock forces after many months of pretty intense fighting. There are stories of ammunition shortages on both sides, and the front lines have not moved appreciably for a while. In perception terms, the issue now seems to be two different narratives about what we are and have seen. The Washington Post published a really interesting article (non-paywalled for now—so go read it) on the fight over the narrative. Its really worth a read. </p><p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/07/ukraine-russia-narrative-war-control/</p><p>One of the most pointed parts of the article was directed at the analyst community that has tried to Monday Morning Quarterback the entire counteroffensive (usually criticizing Ukraine for not fighting the NATO way or being too casualty-sensitive), and seems to be itching to describe the counteroffensive as a failure. Here is the best excerpt.</p><p><em>But at the same briefing, the official tried to lower expectations. In an extended reply to a question, the official took aim at the idea that victory for Ukraine would mean expelling Russia from “every bit of territory by X date” — though Zelensky has declared that Ukraine must reclaim all its land.</em></p><p><em>With Finland and Sweden joining NATO and Ukraine on a path to European integration, defining victory in these terms is “insane,” the official said, exasperated.</em></p><p><em>In a different briefing, a senior NATO official lamented “Monday morning quarterbacking” from analysts who personally have little on the line.</em></p><p><em>“It’s easy for you to sit as an analyst somewhere and look at this and say, well, I would have done different,” the official said. “Well, that’s great, but you don’t literally have a gun in your face. Your family hasn’t been wiped out. It’s not your country that’s invaded.”</em><a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></p><p>Its important to get this narrative out. During some recent travels I actually heard the anti-Ukraine narrative that is being developed by some analysts, particularly those who drastically overrated Russian military strength before Feb 24, 2022. Here is their narrative, which I think you can expect to hear publicly more and more:</p><p>Overall the view will be from the analysts who have been second guessing Ukraine that Ukraine had a great opportunity in the counteroffensive, but blew it because of their own mistakes and major Russian military improvements. The Ukrainians started the counteroffensive in a slip-shod way in early June, by launching the major effort without probing and stumbling into a well-prepared Russian kill zone. At that point the Ukrainians made too hasty a decision to abandon NATO combined arms tactics, and instead moved to the slow, attritional war that we have seen. This was a disaster, and now the war is favoring Russia, who is gearing up its war industries and will be gaining the upper hand in the coming months. Ultimately you will hear the analysts say that while they support Ukraine, the war is basically a stalemate that concessions should now be made for Russia to have a peace deal. </p><p>This narrative is coming.</p><p>I find this narrative unconvincing, as I wrote this week in the Atlantic. What has happened this summer is due to the fact, as I warned in March, that Ukraine was being armed to launch frontal assaults and being deprived of the weapons needed to degrade Russian capabilities behind the lines. This is what I wrote in March in the <em>Atlantic</em>, decrying the reality that we were supporting Ukraine to attack the Russian front lines, but depriving Ukraine of the ranged fires to destroy the logistis and command/control which underlay the Russian front line.</p><p><em>In light of such dynamics, the manner in which the West is supporting Ukraine’s war effort is deeply frustrating. Though NATO countries have a variety of systems that can target Russian forces deep behind their lines, recent aid has been overwhelmingly geared toward preparing Ukraine to make direct assaults against the Russian army. The most widely discussed forms of equipment—such as Leopard 2 tanks, Bradley armored personnel carriers, and even Archer long-range artillery—are not the kinds of systems that can disrupt or degrade Russian forces far behind the front lines.</em> </p><p><em>In short, Ukraine is being made to fight the war the hard way, not the smart way.</em><a id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></p><p>Such calls went unheeded, of course, until the British and then French showed up with a small number of Storm Shadow/Scalp cruise missiles. What Ukraine has been able to accomplish with this small supply shows what a missed opportunity it was not to supply Ukraine before the counteroffensive with a range of such systems to deconstruct Russian logistics. Fears of escalation, groundless in my mind, caused Ukrainian aid to be limited in stupid ways. As I argued this week in the Atlantic, we cant afford to make such mistakes again.</p><p><em>Helping Ukraine win the war as quickly as possible is imperative. It’s also the best way to limit future destruction and casualties. Yet the combination of Russian nuclear threats and the West’s outdated visions of major tank breakthroughs has put Ukraine in a difficult position. Because frontal assaults are so dangerous and vehicles are so vulnerable to attack, the Ukrainians have been proceeding on foot, undertaking <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-fall-offensive-predominantly-infantry-152600047.html?guccounter=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">an infantry-based campaign</a> that could continue all autumn and even into the winter. The more that Western allies prioritize long-range weapons, the more Ukraine can wear down Russian resistance and take back its own territory.</em><a id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></p><p>Hopefully instead of listening to the doom-and-gloom narrative about the Ukrainian offensive, which is on its way, people will understand that the real issue in the war is that Ukraine has been forced to fight this way. Its been a profoundly short-sighted decision by those who make the decisions on what Ukraine has received. Its lengthened the war and made it bloodier and more terrible. The best narrative going forward should be not doom and gloom, but lets learn and understand the best way to help Ukraine win.</p><p><strong>Podcast Update:</strong></p><p>Mykola Bielieskov and I are trying to professionalize our Ukraine-Russia War Talk podcast. We are working to get the sound quality right, do audio editing, etc. Its taking a little longer than anticipated (we had a bit of an audio-fiasco this week).
