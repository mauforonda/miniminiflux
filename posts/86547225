<p>Pattern matching is so ubiquitous in life.(?)(!) <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="https://juicetin.bearblog.dev/feed/?type=rss#fn-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">1</a></sup></p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>math and probability problems as you&#39;re trying to understand the flavor of the question,</p>
<p>learning the intricacies of a new languages both spoken and coded,</p>
<p>familiarizing yourself with the patterns of new york under your feet and getting better at navigating this city by transit the longer you live here, (<em>&#34;oh you can just take the F til Broadway-Lafayette and make a transfer to the 6, or the Q from DeKalb works too, ooo or Borough Hall 4/5 always an option–&#34;</em>)</p>
<p><em>literally</em> pattern matching as you write out Haskell code,</p>
<p>leetcoding and applying the data structures and algos you&#39;ve learned in days past to see what would optimally solve this fun little problem,</p>
<p>living out our lives trying to discern wisdom by matching to what we&#39;ve experienced in the past?</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>funny that a functional programming concept from my freshman fall CS class that I dismissed as entirely unnecessary has, in the most ironic fashion, become a <em>pattern</em> that I&#39;ve matched to again and again.</p>
<p>in living document fashion, maybe the more patterns I notice over time, the longer this list will grow.</p>
