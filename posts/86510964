<p>To tackle climate change we’ll have to put our faith in technologies that don’t yet exist. That is the thesis of my <em>Exponentially</em> conversation with the legendary entrepreneur and investor, Vinod Khosla.</p><p>When I first met Vinod a quarter of a century ago, he was well known as a technology founder and investor in traditional IT. He co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982, a Silicon Valley legend, company ahead of its time. While at Kleiner Perkins, Vinod incubated and invested in Juniper Networks, which earned the firm $7 billion and made it Vinod’s largest ROI to date. </p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KCwtb7qoSY0?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" loading="lazy"></iframe><p>More recently, Vinod has gained a reputation in a new area: funding entrepreneurs who are developing hard technologies to tackle climate change. Vinod is particularly focused on a dozen high-emitting areas, including agriculture, industrial and domestic heat, steel and cement, and aviation fuel.</p><blockquote><p>If you solve this, the climate problem is done.</p></blockquote><p>The experience of building for the early Internet is informing every aspect of Vinod’s approach to climate tech, including how he thinks about what is possible and what is risky… </p><blockquote><p>When we started Juniper in 1996, every major telco player told me they would never use TCP/IP on the public internet. So, these internet technologies were taboo in the telecom world. […] Uncertainty is a critical part of what we’re dealing with [<em>regarding climate change</em>]. Only the unprobables are important — because it’s the only way to do technology multiplication that can benefit 7 billion people. </p></blockquote><p>The conversation is worth watching even if you’re outside of climate tech — and, as always, if you found this insightful, please consider…</p><ul><li><p>Spreading the word — forward this email to your network or share this post, </p></li><li><p>Like the <a href="https://youtu.be/KCwtb7qoSY0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">YouTube video</a> — the algorithm will work its magic from there,</p></li><li><p>and leave a <a href="https://youtu.be/KCwtb7qoSY0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">thoughtful comment on YT</a> to foster a healthy public conversation. </p></li></ul><p></p>
