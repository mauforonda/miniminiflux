  Things I’ve been working on   Database pingcap assignments are going great. This week was mostly on Data Definition Language. More specifically TinySQL’s DDL (which is a subset of TiDB’s DDL). The asynchronous schema change in TinySQL follows the algorithm for schema changes in Google F1. The algorithm is described in the paper Online, Asynchronous Schema Change in F1. Reading the paper is a prerequisite (although focussing on the algo and less on the proof should do) to understand what was going on in the code and add code for the missing parts for updateVersionAndTableInfo, Add Column, and Drop Column.
