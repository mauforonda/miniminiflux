For example, Meta is paying one top creator around $5 million over two years for about six hours of studio work. The deal is also non-exclusive, which means it allows the celebrities to also work with other AI services.</p><p>The AI avatars are currently text-based chatbots on Meta&#39;s platforms, but Zuckerberg said voice capabilities are coming in 2023.</p><p>Why should I care?</p><p>Meta is still all-in on its vision for the metaverse and AI, despite its recent struggles. Meta seems willing to pay top dollar to partner with big names who can draw their massive audiences to use the AI avatars. If the celebrity avatars take off, they could be a blueprint for how creators monetize their brands in virtual worlds. There&#39;s also a chance Meta pulls the plug on funding if user traction is low, just as it did with Facebook Watch originals.</p><p><a href="https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/meta-paying-celebrities-millions-dollars-ai-chatbots?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=here-s-who-gets-paid-for-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share this story</a></p><h6>QUICK BITES</h6><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=here-s-who-gets-paid-for-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Open AI is exploring making its own AI chips</a> to solve its shortage of expensive AI chips that power its software and products.

CEO Sam Altman has made acquiring more AI chips a top priority given Open AI&#39;s reliance on Nvidia, which controls over 80% of the AI chip market.</p><p>Why should I care?</p><p>Custom AI chips could significantly reduce Open AI&#39;s hardware costs and chip shortage issues, allowing it to scale its AI technologies more easily. However, building custom AI chips is a complex and expensive endeavour that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars with no guarantee of success. Even if Open AI acquires a chip company, it would still take years to develop its own chips.</p><p><a href="https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/openai-exploring-making-ai-chips?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=here-s-who-gets-paid-for-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share this story</a></p><h6>QUICK BITES</h6><p>The folks at US State Department have done an analysis focused on the EU Parliament&#39;s version of the AI Act, which includes rules on generative AI.

This could dampen productivity gains and investment in the EU, limiting competitiveness. The rules may also hamper investment in AI research and commercialization in the EU, since training large language models requires substantial resources.</p><p>The US shared this feedback with EU counterparts in recent weeks. Some of the concerns echo those of EU member states regarding the Parliament&#39;s proposal. This analysis aligns with the US preference for a light touch approach to AI regulation to foster innovation. But the US has sent mixed messages, with some officials warming to the idea of mandatory rules amid ethical concerns about AI.</p><p>Why should I care?</p><p>The US analysis highlights key differences in regulatory approaches between the US and EU. How the EU regulates foundational AI technologies could impact innovation and the competitiveness of EU firms. If regulations are too stringent, investment and jobs may migrate out of the EU. But lax rules also risk potential harms from uncontrolled AI advances. Finding the right balance will shape the future AI landscape.</p><p><a href="https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/us-warns-eu-ai-act?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=here-s-who-gets-paid-for-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Share this story</a></p><h3>Ben‚Äôs Bites Insights</h3><p>We have 2 databases that are updated daily which you can access by sharing Ben‚Äôs Bites using the link below;</p><ul><li><p>All 10k+ links we‚Äôve covered, easily filterable (1 referral)</p></li><li><p>6k+ AI company funding rounds from Jan 2022, including investors, amounts, stage etc (3 referrals)</p></li></ul><p></p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=111fcea6-e265-48fd-87d0-bbbf179c3cb7&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
