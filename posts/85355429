Reducing cartel recruitment is the only way to lower violence in Mexico</h2>
<p>RAFAEL PRIETO-CURIEL , GIAN MARIA CAMPEDELLI, AND ALEJANDRO HOPE<br/>SCIENCE 21 Sep 2023 Vol 381, Issue 6664 pp. 1312-1316 DOI: 10.1126/science.adh2888</p>
<p>Mexican cartels lose many members as a result of conflict with other cartels and incarcerations. Yet, despite their losses, cartels manage to increase violence for years. We address this puzzle by leveraging data on homicides, missing persons, and incarcerations in Mexico for the past decade along with information on cartel interactions. We model recruitment, state incapacitation, conflict, and saturation as sources of cartel size variation. Results show that by 2022, cartels counted 160,000 to 185,000 units, becoming one of the country’s top employers. Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week is essential to avoid their collapse because of aggregate losses. Furthermore, we show that increasing incapacitation would increase both homicides and cartel members. Conversely, reducing recruitment could substantially curtail violence and lower cartel size.</p>

Mark Newman | Leaders and Best: Networks and Ranking in Sports, Markets, and Society</h2>
<p>One of the oldest of network problems is the ranking of individuals, teams, or commodities on the basis of pairwise comparisons between them. For example, if you know which football teams beat which others in a particular year, can you say which team is the best overall? This is a harder problem than it sounds because not all pairs of teams play games in a given season, and also because the outcomes of the games can be ambiguous or contradictory. This talk will introduce the techniques used to solve such ranking problems, with examples from games and sports, consumer research and marketing, and social hierarchies in both animal and human communities, then ask how those techniques can be extended to answer a range of new questions about competition and ranking, including the development of new computer algorithms for ranking, questions about the varying patterns of competition in different sports, and what happens when individuals or teams compete in multiple different ways.</p>

How Output Outweighs Input and Interlocutors Matter for Study-Abroad SLA: Computational Social Network Analysis of Learner Interactions (winner, Best of MLJ for 2022 paper award)</h2>

<p>This data-driven study framed in the interactionist approach investigates the influence of social graph topology and peer interaction dynamics among foreign exchange students enrolled in an intensive German language course on second language acquisition (SLA) outcomes. Applying the algorithms and metrics of computational social network analysis (SNA), we find that (a) the best predictor of target language (TL) performance is reciprocal interactions in the language being acquired, (b) the proportion of output in the TL is a stronger predictor than input (Principle of Proportional Output), (c) there is a negative relationship between performance and interactions with same-first-language speakers, (d) a significantly underperforming English native-speaker dominated cluster is present, and (e) there are more intense interactions taking place between students of different proficiency levels. Unlike previous study abroad social network research concentrating on the microlevel of individual learners’ egocentric networks and presenting an emic view only, this study constitutes the first application of computational SNA to a complete learner network (sociogram). It provides new insights into the link between social relations and SLA with an etic perspective, showing how social network configuration and peer learner interaction are stronger predictors of TL performance than individual factors such as attitude or motivation, and offering a rigorous methodology for investigating the phenomenon.</p>

The role of intra-guild indirect interactions in assembling plant-pollinator networks</h2>

<p>Understanding the assembly of plant-pollinator communities has become critical to their conservation given the rise of species invasions, extirpations, and species’ range shifts. Over the course of assembly, colonizer establishment produces core interaction patterns, called motifs, which shape the trajectory of assembling network structure. Dynamic assembly models can advance our understanding of this process by linking the transient dynamics of colonizer establishment to long-term network development. In this study, we investigate the role of intra-guild indirect interactions and adaptive foraging in shaping the structure of assembling plant-pollinator networks by developing: 1) an assembly model that includes population dynamics and adaptive foraging, and 2) a motif analysis tracking the intra-guild indirect interactions of colonizing species throughout their establishment. We find that while colonizers leverage indirect competition for shared mutualistic resources to establish, adaptive foraging maintains the persistence of inferior competitors. This produces core motifs in which specialist and generalist species coexist on shared mutualistic resources which leads to the emergence of nested networks. Further, the persistence of specialists develops richer and less connected networks which is consistent with empirical data. Our work contributes new understanding and methods to study the effects of species’ intra-guild indirect interactions on community assembly.</p>

Meaning from movement and stillness: Signatures of coordination dynamics reveal infant agency</h2>
<p>Aliza T. Sloan, Nancy Aaron Jones, and J. A. Scott Kelso</p>
<p>PNAS 120 (39) e2306732120</p>
<p>How do human beings make sense of their relation to the world and realize their ability to effect change? Applying modern concepts and methods of coordination dynamics, we demonstrate that patterns of movement and coordination in 3 to 4-mo-olds may be used to identify states and behavioral phenotypes of emergent agency. By means of a complete coordinative analysis of baby and mobile motion and their interaction, we show that the emergence of agency can take the form of a punctuated self-organizing process, with meaning found both in movement and stillness.</p>

<p>Strongly opinionated minorities can have a dramatic impact on the opinion dynamics of a large population. Two factions of inflexible minorities, polarised into two competing opinions, could lead the entire population to persistent indecision. Equivalently, populations can remain undecided when individuals sporadically change their opinion based on individual information rather than social information. Our analysis compares the cross-inhibition model with the voter model for decisions between equally good alternatives, and with the weighted voter model for decisions among alternatives characterised by different qualities. Here we show that cross-inhibition, contrary to the other two models, is a simple mechanism that allows the population to reach a stable majority for one alternative even in the presence of a relatively high amount of asocial behaviour. The results predicted by the mean-field models are confirmed by experiments with swarms of 100 locally interacting robots. This work suggests an answer to the longstanding question of why inhibitory signals are widespread in natural systems of collective decision making, and, at the same time, it proposes an efficient mechanism for designing resilient swarms of minimalistic robots. Reaching group consensus without a leader can be jeopardized by even a minimal number of self-willed individuals. This study shows that, when individuals use inhibitory signals, a stable consensus is guaranteed, thus suggesting an answer to the longstanding question of why inhibition is widespread in natural systems of collective decision making.</p>

Reinforcement learning-based aggregation for robot swarms</h2>
<p>Arash Sadeghi Amjadi, Cem Bilaloğlu, Ali Emre Turgut, Seongin Na, Erol Şahin, Tomáš Krajník, Farshad Arvin<br/>Adaptive Behavior</p>
<p>Aggregation, the gathering of individuals into a single group as observed in animals such as birds, bees, and amoeba, is known to provide protection against predators or resistance to adverse environmental conditions for the whole. Cue-based aggregation, where environmental cues determine the location of aggregation, is known to be challenging when the swarm density is low. Here, we propose a novel aggregation method applicable to real robots in low-density swarms. Previously, Landmark-Based Aggregation (LBA) method had used odometric dead-reckoning coupled with visual landmarks and yielded better aggregation in low-density swarms. However, the method’s performance was affected adversely by odometry drift, jeopardizing its application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a novel Reinforcement Learning-based Aggregation method, RLA, is proposed to increase aggregation robustness, thus making aggregation possible for real robots in low-density swarm settings. Systematic experiments conducted in a kinematic-based simulator and on real robots have shown that the RLA method yielded larger aggregates, is more robust to odometry noise than the LBA method, and adapts better to environmental changes while not being sensitive to parameter tuning, making it better deployable under real-world conditions.</p>
