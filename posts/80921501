<h1>In certain uptown literati circles, this is like watching a Borzoi be fed to a wood chipper.</h1>

<p>Just a wildly evocative alien sentence amidst a story that is otherwise mostly alien in a bygone-era, imagine-having-that-kind-of-financial-stability sort of way. Do people who live uptown disproportionately own Borzois? Are wood chippers a standard amenity of Upper West Side co-ops? Mysteries abound.  </p>

<h1>It moves through the world as though it is a human zoo and interprets the world through the empathetic gaze.</h1>

<p>The first time I remember hearing Jade talk about her critique of empathy was at a panel for the Theorizing the Web conference. Specifically the moment that stuck with me was her patient and pointed response to an audience member who wanted clarification on the critique (in my mind this audience member was a bit upset at the implication that empathy might not be default good, but I may have convinced myself this was the case for dramatic effect). I remember Jade talking about the distinction between <em>compassion</em> and <em>empathy</em>, a nuance that I find very useful for thinking through narrative. It&#39;s very cool to see these ideas that Jade&#39;s been working with for so long take form in this book, both because it&#39;s more concrete that remembering a panel from nearly a decade ago and because Jade is an excellent writer. (To be clear, this sentence is about whiteness which Jade argues very effectively is deeply bound up with contemporary notions and applications of &#34;empathy&#34; as a concept.)</p>
