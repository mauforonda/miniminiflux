Every day I open my LinkedIn and Twitter (and Mastodon and Bluesky and Threads….) and am innundated with the same messages: LLMs are sent to us from above, they make everyone’s life easier, we are quantizing and pruning, going faster, getting smaller, they will change education, they will write our poetry, they will outlive us all and overthrow humanity and build a happy fruitful LLM robot society, generating art and text, a society where humans exist solely to bring them cyberdrinks with small digital umbrellas.
