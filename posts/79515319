<p>Writing in from Washington, DC, my once-hometown and
the birthplace of <a href="https://mapbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Mapbox</a>.
This one will be quick because I’m between one thing
and another!</p>

<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>

and there are some hits in it. I especially love this
track ‘Bubbles,’ which really could be a radio hit.</p>

<p>I’ve also been listening to <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/spellcaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried</a>,
which will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,
movies, books about SBF. But it’s pretty good.
Bloomberg puts out good content!</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>I read <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/07/03/wealth-without-borders.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Capital Without Borders</a>,
which is a great add-on if you’ve already read Piketty’s Capital
or anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed
perspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,
and how it affects the word.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crabgrass-Frontier-Suburbanization-United-States/dp/0195049837" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Crabgrass Kingdom</a>,
which I found via the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/magazine/vienna-social-housing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">New York Times piece on Vienna</a>.
It’s pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was
published in the 80s, US cities hadn’t started their arc back
toward growth and power. Still pretty good, though!</p>

<p>The Vienna piece is also highly recommended. Very few commentators
have said so clearly that we can’t fix America’s housing problems
without letting go of our obsession with owning houses as investments.
The <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-henry-george-program/id1241740873" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Henry George Program</a>
did, but of course they would.</p>

<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>

<p>I watched some trash this month - <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-terminator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">The Terminator</a>,
<a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/they-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">They Live</a>, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/next/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Next</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think I ran out of the <em>good</em> Nic Cage movies
four movies ago and it’s a slog to watch all the rest.
Only 22% done with watching the whole Cage filmography.</p>
