Simple answer: it predicts the next token according to an input, based on its training and reinforcement learning. But is there more to it than that? Somewhere along this learning process, could the LLM be building some kind of understanding of the world, a “world model”? This concept of a world model is currently the subject of hot debate across the AI community. (I talked about the <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/p/the-cow-and-the-academics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">many disagreements in generative AI and how to deal with them in Friday’s essay</a>.)</p><p>The latest salvo comes from MIT researchers Wes Gurnee and Max Tegmark, who recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02207.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">published a paper arguing that</a> </p><blockquote><p>modern LLMs acquire structured knowledge about fundamental dimensions such as space and time, supporting the view that they learn not merely superficial statistics, but literal world models.</p></blockquote><p>LLMs, the authors argue, have a world view because they appear to have a structured notion of space. There is a constant, stable structure of relationships underneath the statistical relationships.</p><p>But is this proof of a world model? And how could we tell? First, it depends on how you define a world model. The idea that intelligent systems (animals included) must have an internal model of how the world works is not a recent one. Nvidia’s Jim Fan offered a good summary of how our understanding of world models in AI has developed over recent years, one key aspect being that they <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1709947595525951787" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">capture causality and intuitive physics</a>. An LLM would have to show more than predictive capacity, an actual causal understanding and ability to simulate the physical world. However, an understanding of, say, geography wouldn’t support an understanding of the physical laws and causality of the world.  explains that this appearance of having a structure to the knowledge doesn’t mean you have an understanding of the knowledge sufficient for it to be called a “model”. In fact, he shows that <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/muddles-about-models?r=8tdk6&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">much more primitive AIs contain correlations about physical space</a>. </p><p>A lot of the internal machinations of our LLM helpers remain a mystery, but this kind of research, and most importantly the discussions it provokes, brings us closer to understanding them. </p><p>See also: A study has found that<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01783.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> LLMs provide useful feedback on research manuscripts, in some cases better than human feedback</a>.

As we wrote in <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/p/exponential-retrospective-september" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">our monthly retrospective</a>, the global EV market is heating up. In Q3 2023, Chinese car maker BYD sold 431,603 fully electric vehicles, up 23% from Q2, and only about 3000 cars less than Tesla. The gap had never been so small. Tesla will need to remain agile to keep its lead. BYD established its dominance in the Chinese market by selling affordable EVs, which appealed to a wide base of customers. Earlier this year, the company added two luxury cars to its offering, breaking into the $100,000+ market. It’s wonderful to see how the formerly unpopular, clunky and un-sexy EVs are now becoming very popular, although a Chinese dominance in yet another market that might be cause for concern. </p><h3><strong>Market data</strong></h3><p>The price of Chinese-made LFP and NMC lithium-ion batteries has dropped below <a href="https://twitter.com/IntercalationSt/status/1709633514834964617" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">$100 per kilowatt-hour</a>, a key threshold for affordability.</p><p>Around 80% of Bloomberg’s clients predict that <a href="https://twitter.com/barnettenergy/status/1709214355294695575" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">the oil and gas industry will outperform other energy sectors over the next 12 to 24 months</a>. </p><p>On September 30th, rooftop solar panels provided enough electricity to meet all of South Australia’s demand during the early afternoon, <a href="https://x.com/assaadrazzouk/status/1708756157370712164?s=51&amp;t=x7VrGz6qT5yK5HkIaWJssA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">peaking at 101%</a>, with total renewable energy generation reaching 114%.
