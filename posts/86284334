They’re important and I’m not going to blanket-ban all discussion, but take a second before you hit “post” to think about how some readers here might have family members who are affected, and how everyone involved is a human being who’s experiencing these events in real life. I will have a hair trigger for deleting posts and permabanning commenters.</p>
