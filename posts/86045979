<p>Google announced the upcoming <a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/google-assistant-bard-generative-ai/?utm_source=bensbites&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=google-will-add-bard-to-its-assistant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">combination of Google Assistant and Bard.</a> At the Made by Google launch event, Google teased “Assistant with Bard” - the personal assistant with generative AI.</p><h2>What&#39;s going on here?</h2><p>Google showcases its plans for integrating Bard into Google Assistant.</p><img alt="" src="https://reader.miniflux.app/proxy/E1aJZoDouzI6hzyKF2jAu-r1YwYyrRtpvd729mg1K-g=/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpYS5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbS9jZG4tY2dpL2ltYWdlL2ZpdD1zY2FsZS1kb3duLGZvcm1hdD1hdXRvLG9uZXJyb3I9cmVkaXJlY3QscXVhbGl0eT04MC91cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0L2ZpbGUvYzVjZjg2NjAtZGUzYy00NDE0LTg5Y2ItNWM5ZmMwY2M4NzE4L2ltYWdlLnBuZw==" loading="lazy"/><h2>What does this mean?</h2><p>This new assistant aims to make it easier to manage tasks like planning trips, sorting emails, making grocery lists, and sending texts - as a human assistant would. The Assistant as usual will access the web and your apps to bring all the context, over which Bard will reason and generate answers/commands which the Assistant can then carry out. Assistant with Bard will be available as an opt-in after testing.</p><h2>Why should I care?</h2><p>The current lineup of features coming to Bard has been pushing it into a personal assistant direction. Still, accessing Bard via a website on your smartphone is not the ideal UX. Assistant with Bard is the natural progression for Google—the one that can finally create a seamless assistant experience.</p><br/><a href="https://www.beehiiv.com/?utm_campaign=c23887d8-c051-4d81-be32-e2d72b641da5&amp;utm_medium=post_rss&amp;utm_source=ben_s_bites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Powered by beehiiv</a>
